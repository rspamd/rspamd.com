<div markdown="1">
Supported distributions:

- **CentOS 7** (x86_64), requires EPEL.
- **CentOS 8** (x86_64), requires EPEL.

Please note that `CentOS` rpm packages **requires** [EPEL](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) to be installed in your system as many dependencies are missing from the base CentOS repositories. You can learn how to install EPEL from their site: <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL>.
`Fedora` packages do not require EPEL or any other third-party repository. Please bear in mind, that you might also need debug symbols package for Rspamd to be able to fill bug reports about possible crashes. Debug symbols are placed in `rspamd-debug` package and could be safely installed even in the production environment.

To install rspamd repo, please download the corresponding repository file and the signing key (both repo and all packages are signed with my GPG key). You could use the following commands to install rspamd <a class="undecor" href="#stableSys1">stable<sup>1</sup></a> RPM repository:

    curl https://rspamd.com/rpm-stable/centos-7/rspamd.repo > /etc/yum.repos.d/rspamd.repo # For Centos-7
    #curl https://rspamd.com/rpm-stable/centos-8/rspamd.repo > /etc/yum.repos.d/rspamd.repo # Uncomment for Centos-8
    rpm --import https://rspamd.com/rpm-stable/gpg.key
    yum update
    yum install rspamd


For <a class="undecor" href="#experimentalSys1">experimental<sup>2</sup></a> branch packages, download `rpm-experimental` repofile as following:

    curl https://rspamd.com/rpm/centos-7/rspamd-experimental.repo > /etc/yum.repos.d/rspamd.repo # For Centos-7
    #curl https://rspamd.com/rpm/centos-8/rspamd-experimental.repo > /etc/yum.repos.d/rspamd.repo # Uncomment for Centos-8
    rpm --import https://rspamd.com/rpm/gpg.key
    yum update
    yum install rspamd


For <a class="undecor" href="#asanSys1">asan<sup>2</sup></a> branch packages, download `rpm-experimental-asan` repofile as following:

    curl https://rspamd.com/rpm-asan/centos-7/rspamd-experimental.repo > /etc/yum.repos.d/rspamd.repo # For Centos-7
    #curl https://rspamd.com/rpm-asan/centos-8/rspamd-experimental.repo > /etc/yum.repos.d/rspamd.repo # Uncomment for Centos-8
    rpm --import https://rspamd.com/rpm/gpg.key

            <h3>Debian and Ubuntu Linux</h3>
<div markdown="1">

Rspamd supports the following .deb based distributives:

- **Debian bookworm** (since 3.5)
- **Debian bullseye**
- **Ubuntu focal** (since 2.5)
- **Ubuntu jammy** (since 3.3)

To install the rspamd <a class="undecor" href="#stableSys2">stable<sup>1</sup></a> apt repository, please use the following commands:

~~~bash
#apt update # if running a minimal system
#apt-get install sudo # if running a minimal system
sudo apt-get install -y lsb-release wget gpg  # optional
CODENAME=`lsb_release -c -s`
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
wget -O- https://rspamd.com/apt-stable/gpg.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/rspamd.gpg > /dev/null
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/rspamd.gpg] http://rspamd.com/apt-stable/ $CODENAME main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rspamd.list
echo "deb-src [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/rspamd.gpg] http://rspamd.com/apt-stable/ $CODENAME main"  | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rspamd.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install rspamd
~~~

	
If you have `ubuntu-bionic` or `debian-buster`, then you might need to add llvm repository as Rspamd now requires a compatible standard c++ library that supports C++ 20 standard since version 3.5. To enable this repo you can use the following commands:

~~~bash
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common # For ubuntu-bionic only
add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test # For ubuntu-bionic only
wget -O - https://apt.llvm.org/llvm-snapshot.gpg.key|sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb http://apt.llvm.org/$CODENAME/ llvm-toolchain-$CODENAME-16 main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/llvm-16.list
echo "deb-src http://apt.llvm.org/$CODENAME/ llvm-toolchain-$CODENAME-16 main"  | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/llvm-16.list
sudo apt-get update
~~~

This step might be needed for other distributives when their libraries are getting incompatible with Rspamd. Please check the [llvm apt documentation](https://apt.llvm.org/) about how to install those for your system.

For [Hyperscan](https://www.hyperscan.io/) and [LuaJIT](https://luajit.org) information see the [FAQ]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/doc/faq.html).

For <a class="undecor" href="#experimentalSys2">experimental<sup>2</sup></a> branch replace `apt-stable` with just `apt`:

~~~bash
#apt update # if running a minimal system
#apt-get install sudo # if running a minimal system
sudo apt-get install -y lsb-release wget gpg  # optional
CODENAME=`lsb_release -c -s`
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
wget -O- https://rspamd.com/apt-stable/gpg.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/rspamd.gpg > /dev/null
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/rspamd.gpg] http://rspamd.com/apt/ $CODENAME main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rspamd.list
echo "deb-src [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/rspamd.gpg] http://rspamd.com/apt/ $CODENAME main"  | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rspamd.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install rspamd
~~~

For <a class="undecor" href="#asanSys2">ASAN<sup>2</sup></a> branch install `rspamd-asan` package instead of `rspamd` (since 3.5).

Please bear in mind, that you might also need debug symbols package for Rspamd to be able to fill bug reports about possible crashes. Debug symbols are placed in `rspamd-dbg` (or `rspamd-asan-dbg`) package and could be safely installed even in the production environment.
Check [the quick start document]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/quickstart.html#rspamd-installation) for further steps.

### Packages support policy

Check [the support policy document]({{ site.baseurl }}/packages_support_policy.html) to clarify what OS versions are supported by Rspamd packages.

### Debian `standard` repos notes

Please **DO NOT** use those packages, as they are likely outdated and are not supported by Rspamd project in any way (so any associated issue will likely be closed automaticall). If you decide to use those packages then please address any issues to the Debian package maintainers.

- **FreeBSD**
- **NetBSD**
- **OpenBSD**
- **macOS** (using MacPorts)

FreeBSD users can install Rspamd from [ports](https://www.freshports.org/mail/rspamd/) or use the experimental line of packages by [rspamd-devel](https://www.freshports.org/mail/rspamd-devel/) port.

Users of NetBSD (and other systems with pkgsrc) can use [pkgsrc](https://pkgsrc.se/mail/rspamd).

OpenBSD users can use [ports](https://openports.se/mail/rspamd).

macOS users can install from [MacPorts](https://ports.macports.org/port/rspamd):
```
sudo port install rspamd
sudo port load rspamd
```

            <h3>Build rspamd from the sources</h3>
<div markdown="1">

If there are no packages for your system or you want custom build options you can also build rspamd from the source code. To do that grab the source from [github](https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd) using `git`:

	git clone --recursive https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd.git

### Build requirements

Rspamd requires several 3-rd party software to build and run:

* [openssl](https://www.openssl.org/) - cryptography and SSL/TLS Toolkit
* [glib2](https://developer.gnome.org/glib/) - common purposes library
* [ragel](https://www.colm.net/open-source/ragel/) - state machine compiler.
* [LuaJIT](https://luajit.org/) - jit compiler for [lua](https://www.lua.org/) programming language. Plain Lua should work as well.
* [cmake](https://cmake.org/) - build system used to configure rspamd
* [sqlite3](https://sqlite.org/) - embedded database used to store some data by rspamd
* [libmagic](https://www.darwinsys.com/file/) - common library for detecting file types
* [libicu](http://site.icu-project.org/) - unicode library
* [PCRE](https://www.pcre.org/) - regular expressions library
* [Hyperscan](https://hyperscan.io)/[Vectorscan](https://github.com/VectorCamp/vectorscan) - optional regexp performance boost library
* [zlib](https://zlib.net/) - compression library

You can either install them from sources or (recommended) install using package manager of your system.

It is also highly recommended to use [Redis](https://redis.io) as it can be used by many Rspamd modules to improve their filtering quality (some modules will be turned off completely without Redis).

It is also recommended to build Rspamd with Hyperscan (x86_64 only) or Vectorscan (aarch64/ppc64le) and Jemalloc to improve performance.

### Build process

To build rspamd we recommend to create a separate build directory:

	$ mkdir rspamd.build
	$ cd rspamd.build
	$ cmake ../rspamd -DENABLE_HYPERSCAN=ON -DENABLE_LUAJIT=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebuginfo
	$ make
	# make install

Alternatively, you can create a distribution package and use it for build your own packages. Here is an example for
[Debian](https://debian.org/) GNU Linux OS:

	$ mkdir rspamd.build
	$ cd rspamd.build
	$ ./dist.sh
	$ tar xvf rspamd-<rspamd_version>.tar.xz
	$ cd rspamd-<rspamd_version>
	$ debuild
