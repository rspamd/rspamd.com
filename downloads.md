            <h3>CentOS, Fedora</h3>
<div markdown="1">
Supported distributions:

- **CentOS 6** (x86_64), requires EPEL
- **CentOS 7** (x86_64), requires EPEL. Hyperscan and LuaJIT are enabled.

Please note that `CentOS` rpm packages **requires** [EPEL](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) to be installed in your system as many dependencies are missing from the base CentOS repositories. You can learn how to install EPEL from their site: <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL>.
`Fedora` packages do not require EPEL or any other third-party repository.

To install rspamd repo, please download the corresponding repository file and the signing key (both repo and all packages are signed with my GPG key). You could use the following commands to install rspamd <a class="undecor" href="#stableSys1">stable<sup>1</sup></a> RPM repository:

    curl https://rspamd.com/rpm-stable/${YOUR_DISTRO}/rspamd.repo > /etc/yum.repos.d/rspamd.repo
    rpm --import https://rspamd.com/rpm-stable/gpg.key
    yum update
    yum install rspamd

Where `${YOUR_DISTRO}` is the short name of your os (e.g. `centos-7` or `fedora-22`).

For <a class="undecor" href="#experimentalSys1">experimental<sup>2</sup></a> branch packages, download `rpm-experimental` repofile as following:

    curl https://rspamd.com/rpm/${YOUR_DISTRO}/rspamd-experimental.repo > /etc/yum.repos.d/rspamd-experimental.repo
    rpm --import https://rspamd.com/rpm/gpg.key
    yum update
    yum install rspamd

<p class="myFootnote" id="stableSys1">1. Use STABLE branch of packages: those packages are the official rspamd releases which are recommended for production usage.</p>
<p class="myFootnote" id="experimentalSys1">2. Use EXPERIMENTAL branch of packages: these packages are less stable and they are generated frequently from the current development branch. Experimental packages usually have more features but might be SOMETIMES broken in some points (nevertheless, bugs are usually quickly fixed after detection).</p>

            <h3>Debian and Ubuntu Linux</h3>
<div markdown="1">

Rspamd supports the following .deb based distributives:

- **Debian jessie** (only x86_64) Hyperscan and LuaJIT are enabled.
- **Debian stretch** (only x86_64) Hyperscan and LuaJIT are enabled.
- **Debian sid** (only x86_64) Hyperscan and LuaJIT are enabled.
- **Ubuntu trusty** (only x86_64) Hyperscan and LuaJIT are enabled.
- **Ubuntu xenial** (only x86_64) Hyperscan and LuaJIT are enabled. 
- **Ubuntu bionic** (only x86_64) Hyperscan and LuaJIT are enabled.

To install the rspamd <a class="undecor" href="#stableSys2">stable<sup>1</sup></a> apt repository, please use the following commands:

    apt-get install -y lsb-release wget # optional
    CODENAME=`lsb_release -c -s`
    wget -O- https://rspamd.com/apt-stable/gpg.key | apt-key add -
    echo "deb [arch=amd64] http://rspamd.com/apt-stable/ $CODENAME main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rspamd.list
    echo "deb-src [arch=amd64] http://rspamd.com/apt-stable/ $CODENAME main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rspamd.list
    apt-get update
    apt-get --no-install-recommends install rspamd

To obtain your distributive's codename, you could use the command `lsb_release -s -c` from the package called `lsb-release`.

For [Hyperscan](https://01.org/hyperscan/) and [LuaJIT](https://luajit.org) information see the [FAQ]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/doc/faq.html).

For <a class="undecor" href="#experimentalSys2">experimental<sup>2</sup></a> branch replace `apt-stable` with just `apt`:

    apt-get install -y lsb-release wget # optional
    CODENAME=`lsb_release -c -s`
    wget -O- https://rspamd.com/apt/gpg.key | apt-key add -
    echo "deb [arch=amd64] http://rspamd.com/apt/ $CODENAME main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rspamd.list
    echo "deb-src [arch=amd64] http://rspamd.com/apt/ $CODENAME main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rspamd.list
    apt-get update
    apt-get --no-install-recommends install rspamd

### Debian `official` repos

Rspamd is also available in some versions of Debian and Ubuntu. However, we are looking for an active maintainer for rspamd in these 'official' repos, as now rspamd is terribly outdated there.

Please **DO NOT** use those packages, as they are no longer supported.

            <h3>BSD systems</h3>
<div markdown="1">
Rspamd has been ported to the following BSD like operating systems:

- **FreeBSD**
- **NetBSD**
- **OpenBSD**
- **macOS** (using MacPorts)

FreeBSD users can install Rspamd from [ports](http://www.freshports.org/mail/rspamd/) or use the experimental line of packages by [rspamd-devel](http://www.freshports.org/mail/rspamd-devel/) port.

Users of NetBSD (and other systems with pkgsrc) can use [pkgsrc](http://pkgsrc.se/mail/rspamd).

OpenBSD users can use [ports](http://openports.se/mail/rspamd).

macOS users can install from [MacPorts](https://github.com/macports/macports-ports/blob/master/mail/rspamd/Portfile):
```
sudo port install rspamd
sudo port load rspamd
```

            <h3>Build rspamd from the sources</h3>
<div markdown="1">

If there are no packages for your system or you want custom build options you can also build rspamd from the source code. To do that grab the source from [github](https://github.com/vstakhov/rspamd) using `git`:

	git clone --recursive https://github.com/vstakhov/rspamd.git

There is also a mirror of rspamd repository: <https://git.rspamd.com/vstakhov/rspamd>

### Build requirements

Rspamd requires several 3-rd party software to build and run:

* [openssl](https://www.openssl.org/) - cryptography and SSL/TLS Toolkit
* [libevent](http://libevent.org/) - asynchronous event library
* [glib2](http://library.gnome.org/devel/glib/) - common purposes library
* [ragel](http://www.colm.net/open-source/ragel/) - state machine compiler. **Please be aware** that the experimental version of Ragel (namely, `7.0`) is **NOT compatible** with Rspamd. Since it is shipped with CentOS 7.0, there is no way to use Ragel from the packages and you need to build compatible Ragel (e.g. 6.8) manually from the source packages or from source code. Ragel is required to **build** Rspamd not to run it.
* [LuaJIT](http://www.luajit.org/) - jit compiler for [lua](http://lua.org) programming language. Plain lua will work as well.
* [cmake](http://www.cmake.org/) - build system used to configure rspamd
* [sqlite3](http://sqlite.org) - embedded database used to store some data by rspamd
* [libmagic](http://www.darwinsys.com/file/) - common library for detecting file types

You can either install them from sources or (recommended) install using package manager of your system.

It is also highly recommended to use [Redis](https://redis.io) as it can be used by many Rspamd modules to improve their filtering quality (some modules will be turned off completely without Redis).

It is also recommended to build Rspamd with Hyperscan (x86_64 only) and Jemalloc to improve performance.

### Build process

To build rspamd we recommend to create a separate build directory:

	$ mkdir rspamd.build
	$ cd rspamd.build
	$ cmake ../rspamd
	$ make
	# make install

Alternatively, you can create a distribution package and use it for build your own packages. Here is an example for
[debian](http://debian.org) GNU Linux OS:

	$ mkdir rspamd.build
	$ cd rspamd.build
	$ cmake ../rspamd
	$ make dist
	$ tar xvf rspamd-<rspamd_version>.tar.xz
	$ cd rspamd-<rspamd_version>
	$ debuild
