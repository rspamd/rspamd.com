We have released **Rspamd 2.5** today.

You can find that the first start of Rspamd will take more time than usually (around 10-30 seconds). That is intended as Rspamd has to recompile some of the url pattern matchers. It will not happen on subsequent restarts nor to the subsequent updates. It should also not happen if you have used Release Candidates for this version.

There are 3 major projects in this release:

- **URL extraction rework**: the URL extraction logic in Rspamd has been significantly reworked to provide better DoS resistance, better matching and lower false positives.
- **URL structure update**: the URL storage structures have been reworked to occupy less memory and use a more efficient storage
- **Hyperscan early load**: since PCRE is a backtracking RE engine it is not very safe to use in conjunction with complicated rules and untrusted data, in this release, Rspamd will load hyperscan database on early stages to avoid PCRE fallback if possible

Several major fixes:

- Base64 detection has been fixed and improved to reduce FP rate
- Query urls are now fully processed
- Bundled libev has been updated to 4.33 (fixing many issues with FD closing race conditions)
- Fixed ANN normalisation
- Fixed redis backend leaks

Useful features:

- Added `whitelisted_signers_map` in ARC module
- Implemented `/etc/hosts` files processing
