---

We have released **Rspamd 3.0** today. The decision to increase the major version number was taken because of the significant changes in the internal architecture Rspamd in many parts, specifically (but not limited) related to the HTML parsing. Rspamd now includes a CSS parser that can deal with the modern emails and properly extract data from them. New code is now written not in Plain C but in C++17 (might be extended to C++20 in future). Hence, to build Rspamd from the source code one would need a C++17 compatible compiler.
This release includes contributions from many people, but I would like to say special thanks to the following persons:

- [Anton Yuzhaninov](https://github.com/citrin) for testing Rspamd and being patient when dealing with the bugs, as well as for the valuable feedback on almost all questions
- [Andrew Lewis](https://github.com/fatalbanana) for constant work on Lua plugins and suggestions about Rspamd architecture
- [Alexander Moisseev](https://github.com/moisseev) for WebUI support and rules testing

Here are the most important changes in this version explained.

## Main changes

### HTML parser rework

Rspamd now parses HTML using a DOM model, so it can build and construct a parsed tree of HTML tags instead of a simple ad-hoc parsing. Adding this feature was quite untrivial, as it required full rewrite of the HTML related code. However, we can see that the new parser can deal with emails in HTML format that were completely ruined by a previous parser. Furthermore, better representation of HTML could lead to more sophisticated rules that take HTML structure into account.

### CSS parser

Rspamd now has an embedded CSS parser that is currently limited to simple selectors but it could be extended in future. In conjunction with the modern HTML parser, CSS support is very valuable to extract the content from emails and distinguish visible and invisible content precisely.

### Amazon S3 support

Rspamd now includes AWS API support (e.g. their signatures schema) which allows to interact with Amazon cloud services directly from Lua API. A simple plugin that stores all messages in AWS S3 cloud has also been written.

### DMARC reporting rework

Rspamd DMARC reporting has proven to be troublesome in the previous version. Therefore, I have decided to move reports sending logic to a dedicated tool called `rspamadm dmarc_report`. The usage of this tool and DMARC reports in principle is already [documented]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/modules/dmarc.html#reporting).

### DMARC munging support

From version 3.0, Rspamd supports DMARC munging for the mailing list. In this mode, Rspamd will change the `From:` header to some pre-defined address (e.g. a mailing list address) for those messages who have valid DMARC policy with reject/quarantine that would otherwise fail during mailing list forwarding. An example of this technique is defined [here](https://mailman.readthedocs.io/en/release-3.1/src/mailman/handlers/docs/dmarc-mitigations.html).

### External relay plugin

Many plugins, such as SPF, are using IP address provided by an MTA to Rspamd directly. However, in many cases there is a trusted relay that do some initial processing and hides the actual sender's IP address. With help of this new plugin, Rspamd can now 'fix' this issue by treating sender's IP as it is reported by that trusted relay.

### Bayes export tool

Rspamd now allows to save and restore bayes tokens using `rspamadm bayes_dump` subcommand. This feature allows to move tokens between instances of Rspamd, to merge them and to analyse them manually.

### Pyzor support

Rspamd now supports [Pyzor](https://www.pyzor.org/) via [external services plugin]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/modules/external_services.html#pyzor-specific-details), thanks to [@defkev](https://github.com/defkev) for this work!

### Monitoring rework

Monitoring tools are now awaken less frequently reducing load on the external modules.
