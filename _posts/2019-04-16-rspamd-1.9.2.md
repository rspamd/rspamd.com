We have released **Rspamd 1.9.2** today.

This release contains some new features and bug fixes. The only potentially slashing changes are the changes in [Clickhouse module](https://rspamd.com/doc/modules/clickhouse.html):

- Times are now stored in **GMT** timezone so you can use Clickhouse for analytics that crosses time zones. The potential drawback is the mess with the currently stored data. This should be resolved automatically once new data arrives.

- Clickhouse schema has been updated to the version `4` with new fields and some minor changes. The existing database should be converted automatically and there are no incompatible changes in columns.

This release includes the following features.

## Improvements in Clickhouse plugin

Rspamd now stores more data in Clickhouse:

- Mime recipients
- Message IDs
- Scan time for a message, both normal and virtual
- SPF checks results
- Some new calculated columns, such as `MIMERcpt`, `MIMEFrom`, `SMTPFrom` and `SMTPRcpt`

These columns are intended to improve analytical capabilities of Clickhouse plugin.

## OpenDKIM compatible DKIM signing setup

This version now includes a simplified [DKIM signing](https://rspamd.com/doc/modules/dkim_signing.html) setup option inspired with OpenDKIM.

You can read more about it here: <https://rspamd.com/doc/modules/dkim_signing.html#use-of-signing_table>

This mode is intended to simplify migration from the existing setups based on OpenDKIM to Rspamd.

## Better encrypted archives support

Rspamd can now properly detect encryption in ZIP archives. Mime types plugin now also tries to resolve hex encoding hack used by some spammers to send malware to users (see [PR 2582](https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd/pull/2852)).

## Calendar files parser

From the version 1.9.2, Rspamd can extract meaningful data from Calendar files in iCal format (`.ics` files). These files are sometimes used by spammers so Rspamd can now extract hyperlinks and emails from calendar attachments to improve filtering quality.

## New `rspamadm dns_tool` utility

It is now possible to do some DNS checks with the new tool. For example, it is now possible to verify SPF records as they are observed by Rspamd, including elements extraction, for example `a` or `mx` and verification of the IP addresses. Here is how it looks like:
