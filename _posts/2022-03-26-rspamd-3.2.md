We have released **Rspamd 3.2** today. This version is mostly bugfix release with several new features implemented.

Here are the most important changes in this version explained.

## Main changes

### DNS over TCP support

For a long time, Rspamd was unable to switch to TCP when processing DNS replies that are too large to be transferred over UDP. The portion of such a messages was never high, but there are some notable examples of the records that cannot fit into a UDP packet even with EDNS0 extension enabled. That are mostly poorly maintained TXT records that contains lot's of legacy Google verification junk. However, it affected the SPF authentication, so I have decided to implement TCP fallback after all.

### BIMI support

Rspamd can now download and verify logotypes from a validated certificates using a dedicated [helper written in Rust](https://github.com/rspamd/bimi-helper). With this plugin, Rspamd can enrich your emails, appending a header with the logotype image (in SVG format) if all BIMI validation steps were successful.

### Average scan time

It is now possible to fetch an average messages scan time via Rspamd HTTP API, Prometheus endpoint and even via `ps` command (supported on some OS only).

### Monitor helper tool

You can now attach a [CLI helper](https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd-mon) to Rspamd to get some real time performance graphs directly from your terminal:

### Cloudmark support

You can now use Cloudmark via the external services module.

## Other fixes and improvements

### Core and API

 * Fixed SSL support in many places
 * Switched to XXHash3 as a fast hash source
 * Fix upstreams name resolution when there is also a port
 * Allow hyperscan for ppc64, as vectorscan now suports it
 * Lua_magic: Add a sane CSV heuristic
 * Allow to restore SSL handlers after keepalive pooling

### Plugins

 * Neural: dd ROC feature to neural network plugin
 * Fixed retention settings in Clickhouse plugin
 * Fixed important issues in the reputation plugin

### Rules

 * Added some sanity limits for symbol groups
 * Fix symbol for DKIM temporary failure
 * Remove ancient and inefficient rules
