We have released **Rspamd 1.9.3** today.

This release contains some new features and many bug fixes. There are no incompatible changes introduced with this release to our best knowledge.

This release includes the following features and important changes.

## Hashicorp Vault support

From version 1.9.3, Rspamd can use [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) to store and manage DKIM keys. Vault usage provides secure and flexible storage of the private keys that can scale and use various backends to store sensible data (secrets).

There is a new subcommand for `rspamadm` utility called `vault` that is intended to create/remove and securely rotate DKIM private keys using vault.

You can read more about it using the following link: <https://rspamd.com/doc/modules/dkim_signing.html#dkim-signing-using-vault>

## Added least passthrough result

Some modules should set metric result as **least possible** result. For example, DMARC policy failure should at least mark failed messages as spam but it should not prevent messages from being rejected. From this release, such modules use `least` policy to set actions allowing to apply a more strict policy if needed.

## Tunable memory management

From this version, Rspamd allows to manage memory policies for [Lua garbage collection](http://pgl.yoyo.org/luai/i/2.10+Garbage+Collection) allowing to fit memory/cpu constraints more flexible. When Rspamd is built with `jemalloc` (e.g. in the default packages provided by the project), it can also print detailed memory statistics on full gc loops.

Here is an example for tuning GC in Rspamd when there are lots of free memory available (around 1Gb per scanner process):

~~~ucl
# local.d/options.inc
# http://pgl.yoyo.org/luai/i/2.10+Garbage+Collection
lua_gc_step = 100;
lua_gc_pause = 400;
# number of scanned messages to perform full GC iteration 
full_gc_iters = 10000;
~~~

## Improved oversigning logic

It is now possible to oversign existing only headers and ignore it if a header is missing. It is done by changing `(o)` to `(x)`.

The default list of headers signed is changed accordingly:

| Header          | Sign type                         |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| `From`      | Strictly oversign                |
| `Sender`      | Conditionally oversign                |
| `Reply-To`      | Strictly oversign                |
| `Subject`      | Strictly oversign                |
| `Date`      | Conditionally oversign                |
| `Message-Id`      | Conditionally oversign                |
| `To`      | Strictly oversign                |
| `Cc`      | Strictly oversign                |
| `Mime-Version`      | Conditionally oversign                |
| `Content-Type`      | Conditionally oversign                |
| `Content-Transfer-Encoding`      | Conditionally oversign                |
| `Resent-To`      | Do not oversign                |
| `Resent-Cc`      | Do not oversign                |
| `Resent-From`      | Do not oversign                |
| `Resent-Sender`      | Do not oversign                |
| `Resent-Message-Id`      | Do not oversign                |
| `In-Reply-To`      | Conditionally oversign                |
| `References`      | Conditionally oversign                |
| `List-Id`      | Do not oversign                |
| `List-Help`      | Do not oversign                |
| `List-Owner`      | Do not oversign                |
| `List-Unsubscribe`      | Do not oversign                |
| `List-Subscribe`      | Do not oversign                |
| `List-Post`      | Do not oversign                |
| `Openpgp`      | Conditionally oversign                |
| `Autocrypt`      | Conditionally oversign                |
