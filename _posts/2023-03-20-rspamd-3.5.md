## Upgrade notes

In addition to the numerous improvements in Rspamd 3.5, this release introduces some notable changes to the supported platforms. We are excited to announce the provision of arm64 packages, extending Rspamd's compatibility to a wider range of devices. However, as part of our commitment to providing up-to-date and secure software, we have removed support for outdated and end-of-life (EOL) Debian distributions, specifically Ubuntu Bionic and Debian Buster. This decision ensures that our users are running Rspamd on well-maintained platforms with active security updates. For more context on this change and guidance on upgrading your distribution, please refer to the following [document](/packages_support_policy.html)

It is essential to carefully review the upgrading implications to ensure a smooth transition to Rspamd 3.5. These changes allow us to focus on delivering the best possible email filtering solution while promoting the use of secure and up-to-date platforms.
