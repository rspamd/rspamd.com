We have released **Rspamd 2.4** today.

This is a bug fixes release mainly.

3 major projects in this release:

- **Logger system rework**: fixed syslog logging, improved architecture,
improved logging reload
- **URL composition library** (similar to old 2tld map for surbl module),
use this library in RBL module for all URL like objects: urls, emails,
dkim domains
- Implemented **SSL client caching**: it should improve client SSL
connections: Clickhouse, SMTPS, maps check and so on for both client and
a server.

Several major fixes:

- Parsing of the content type attributes
- Avoid collisions in mempool variables
- Fixed Redis Sentinel support
- Fixed IPv6 listening
- Fixed mime modifications for 7bit parts
- Fixed passthrough result and smtp message
- Important eSLD url composition fixes
- Various neural network plugin fixes

Useful features:

- Custom additional columns in [Clickhouse]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/modules/clickhouse.html) plugin
- Support of CDB maps everywhere to share huge maps across workers with
no extra cost
