We have released **Rspamd 1.8.2** today.

There are no incompatible changes introduced with this version to our best knowledge. However, due to Bayes changes, you might see slightly different Bayes outcomes. `rspamd_update` module is now disabled by default as we are working on a better and safer solution that will be available in the next Rspamd version.

## The most important features and fixes

* Critical fixes in [SURBL module](https://rspamd.com/doc/modules/surbl.html)

    SURBL module could insert absurd scores and skip group symbol limit in some cases.

* Critical fixes in [Bayes statistics](https://rspamd.com/doc/configuration/statistic.html)

    Bayes algorithm has been changed significantly in this release:

    - If chi-squared method fails due to `exp` underflow, Rspamd will switch to a naive method
    - Tokens weighting has been reworked to match chi-squared model
    - OSB weights have been adjusted to discriminate more far tokens and increase weight for closer tokens
    - Reworked meta-tokens algorithm, it is now moved to Lua
    - Skip stop words in statistics

* [Fuzzy check](https://rspamd.com/doc/modules/fuzzy_check.html) rework

    In this version, we have moved selection algorithm from C to Lua with more flexibility about parts and data selection.

* Critical fixes in [Ratelimit module](https://rspamd.com/doc/modules/ratelimit.html)

    We have found and fixed various issues in Ratelimit plugin and restored both traditional and modern syntax of ratelimits. Presumably, all version prior this one are broken when dealing with ratelimits. 

* Major rework of all asynchronous rules and events

    In Rspamd 1.8.2, we have introduced new model of asynchronous rules processing with the following features:

    - More straightforward in terms of the control flow
    - It is possible to get better debugging info in case of issues (including the concrete line of code)
    - It is possible now to see the real execution time of rules and show slow rules including network waiting
    - New model is less complex than the previous one

* Critical issue in [ARC module](https://rspamd.com/doc/modules/arc.html)

    We have fixed the issue in ARC module that could lead to around 11% of wrong signatures being produced due to an incorrect `\0` handling in raw RSA signature.

* Add support for encrypted cookies in Message-ID

    It is now possible to generate and check message-ids that require no storage
    and Rspamd even don't need to observe outbound messages. However, it
    will be able to detect replies to our messages and get some more
    information if needed:

    We generate message id using `nonce||aesencrypt(nonce, k, known_cookie)`
    then we can just take a look into `In-Reply-To header` and apply
    `read_nonce() + aesdecrypt(nonce, k)` to compare result with
    known_cookie.

    Nonce length will be 16 bytes (32 hex encoded) and another 16 bytes
    could be used to encrypt secret cookie + some random thing derived from
    the message itself.

* Added [DWL](https://www.dnswl.org/?p=311) support in the default configuration
* Add support of words regexps
* Allow to set custom limits for upstream lists
* Detect orphaned parts and attach them to message
* Support query arguments in controller's custom commands
* Write DKIM selector in dkim allow/reject symbols
