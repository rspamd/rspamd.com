We have released **Rspamd 1.9.0** today.

There are various important features in this release. The vast majority of those should not have any impact on the existing systems. However, you are recommended to read [the Upgrade Notes](https://rspamd.com/doc/migration.html).

This release contains lots of improvements, reworks and bugs being fixed. Here is a list of the most important changes in this release:

## External services

Rspamd is now shipped with the [external services module](https://rspamd.com/doc/modules/external_services.html) contributed by [Carsten Rosenberg](https://github.com/c-rosenberg). This module provides a generic integration with the following services:

* Generic ICAP protocol:
  - ClamAV (using c-icap server and squidclamav)
  - Sophos (via SAVDI)
  - Symantec Protection Engine for Cloud Services
  - Kaspersky Web Traffic Security 6.0
* OleTools
* DCC
* [VadeSecure](https://www.vadesecure.com/en/)

This plugin is a part of a more generic `lua_scanners` framework that allows more flexible integration with different Antivirus and AntiSpam OEM services.

## New mime modify tool in Rspamadm

`Rspamadm` mime subcommand now allows to modify messages. This tool allows to add or remove headers in a message, add footers in HTML and text parts and do some subject rewriting. For example, to add a footer and rewrite subject in a message, one can use the following command: `rspamadm mime modify --text-footer=footer.txt --html-footer=footer.html --rewrite-header="Subject=TEST: %s"`.

This tool has full MIME support (including multipart messages), supports various messages encoding and convert those to `UTF8`, allows to modify both plain old messages and multipart messages with attachments. It also properly detects and excludes GPG signed/encrypted messages.

## Offline DKIM signing tool in Rspamadm

Another tool that has been added to `rspamadm` is `sign` subcommand. This command allows to perform DKIM signing using a specific private key for some message or messages. It can either return isolated header or modify the message itself.

In conjunction with the previous tooling, it could be used to modify and sign messages produced by mailing lists or some local forwarding scripts.

Please bear in mind that this tool is available when using LuaJIT only as it requires FFI interfaces.


## HTTP Keep-Alive support

From this version, Rspamd supports keep-alive in its [HTTP Lua client](https://rspamd.com/doc/lua/rspamd_http.html). This could be used to implement high frequent requests to some external services and to reduce load by keeping the pool of HTTP connections instead of opening a connection per each request.

## New Lua UDP client

Rspamd now support sending of generic UDP requests as well as TCP ones. There are various modes supported, both one-way and two-ways with optional retransmits and timeouts. This module comes with the [documentation](https://rspamd.com/doc/lua/rspamd_udp.html) available.

## Better unicode normalisation

This version comes with further improvements towards unicode normalisation and detecting anomalies. Words now are sanitized from any combining characters after translating to NFKC form.

## Configuration graph utility

You can now visualise your configuration by building the include graph. There is a new tool called `rspamadm configgraph` that takes configuration and convert it to the [graphviz](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/) DOT graph.

## Flexible actions support

Rspamd now support any actions definitions in addition to normal ones. You can set custom actions with thresholds or without (e.g. to set action equal to `phishing` or to `social`). All actions should be explicitly defined in the [configuration](https://rspamd.com/doc/configuration/metrics.html).

## New Received headers parser

We have migrated from a strict RFC compatible state machine to a custom parser for the Received headers. This change allows to extract more data from non-conforming Received headers used by some MTA (Exim is one of the notable examples).

## Telephone URLs support
 
Rspamd now parses and processes telephone URLs. That allows to build blacklist for spam/scam/phishing phones as well as plain URLs.

## Support for ED25519 signatures

Rspamd now supports dual signing and `ed25519` [DKIM signatures](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8463). New ed25519 keys could be generated using `rspamadm dkim_keygen` tool:

```
rspamadm dkim_keygen -t ed25519
CuHc4MOZYXEVH0M4WFQHL5UC2NbVJO8aq2CjGNznxm36mJPlu9GVMfq0lQI1dkeoHByqfsJgMgnCX0vFeMkjoA==
selector._domainkey IN TXT ( "v=DKIM1; k=ed25519; "
	"p=+piT5bvRlTH6tJUCNXZHqBwcqn7CYDIJwl9LxXjJI6A=" ) ;
```

Ed25519 keys are much shorter than RSA providing RSA2048 security margin in just 32 bytes for public keys. Unfortunately, these signatures are not widely supported so dual signing is still required. We believe that support of the modern algorithms in Rspamd would those algorithms to spread.

## Custom functions in Regexp module

[Regexp module](https://rspamd.com/doc/modules/regexp.html) is now extended with [custom Lua functions support](https://rspamd.com/doc/modules/regexp.html#lua-functions). This feature allows to mix fast regexp rules and custom logic of Lua rules without explicit composite rules.

## Added support of gzip archives

Rspamd now support reading filenames from GZip archives that are surprisingly often used by some spam senders. With this feature, Rspamd can filter some tricky scam emails that are targeting to install backdoors or malware on users' machines (e.g. cryptolockers).

## Additional detection of types for attachments

To filter malware and bad attachments that are somehow hidden by malicious `Content-Type` header, Rspamd also performs `libmagic` scan on attachments to detect the real type by its content. This is useful to detect and filter some tricky malware that utilizes bugs in popular email clients.

## Lots of major fixes

This version includes many major fixes that required massive rework to improve stability and performance:

- Race conditions in the maps reading code
- Support RFC2231 encoding in headers
- Better zero characters handling
- Better HTML parsing and handling of the URLs
- Coroutines are now explicitly separated from the async code to prevent tricky race conditions that caused crashes on certain load
- Allow to disable/enable composite symbols
- Lots of fixes in 7z processor
- Detect encrypted rarv5 archives
- Fix ETags support
- Fix processing of NDNs of certain type
- Improved Content-Type parsing
- Fix deletion of the duplicate headers
- Fix parsing of mime parts without closing boundary

We recommend to update Rspamd to this version to apply all these features and fixes.
