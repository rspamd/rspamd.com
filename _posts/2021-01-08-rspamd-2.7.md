We have released **Rspamd 2.7** today.

This is mostly a bug-fix release with no incompatible changes.

Here is a list of the major projects and serious bugfixes where applicable.

### Fixed issues with DKIM and ARC verification

It was possible for some DKIM checks to fail where multiple signatures are present due to a canonicalisation bug. This issue has now been fixed.
Arc plugin has also been fixed to support certain CV values.

### Added support for S/MIME containers

From this version, Rspamd supports .p7 containers and extracting signed parts during the checks. For details see [the following issue](https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd/issues/3568).

### Several important rules rework

[Anton Yuzhaninov](https://github.com/citrin) has reworked many old rules in Rspamd improving their quality and has removed several outdated rules as well.

### Support of caching for regexp multimaps

Regexp maps can now be cached on disk which should improve loading speed of large maps on reload/restart of Rspamd if they are unchanged.

### Neural plugin offline learning

In this mode, Rspamd can train neural network from Clickhouse so it is possible to define better training conditions and manage learning for large systems with more fine grained control.
Please refer to the [corresponding documentation section]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/modules/neural.html#manual-learning) for more details. Thanks to Andrew Lewis for implementing this functionality.
