We have released **Rspamd 3.3** today. There are incompatible changes in this release, so please get familiar with the [upgrade guide](https://rspamd.com/doc/migration.html).

Here are the most important changes in this version explained.

## Main changes

### Reworked and redesigned symbols cache

Symbols cache is responsible for rules exectuion and planning. In this release, there was a major rework of it's logic and functionality. For example, it can now keep track of timeouts, plan fast events before slow and implement real passthrough for the rules that define such a behaviour. It is useful, when you want some rule to be executed as quick as possible to block or pass evident spam/ham without wasting network/cpu resources. The major drawback of such a rework is that passthrough rules are now really passthrough and can prevent other rules from being executed (that is expected from the design, but it could be not the case before).

### Critical fix in the neural network module

There was a regression introduced in the version 3.2 that prevented old keys in Redis to be cleaned that caused infinite Redis database growth. This is fixed in the release 3.3 and the mitigation of this bug are described in the [upgrade guide](https://rspamd.com/doc/migration.html).

### DKIM parser now ignores unknown tags

By standard, DKIM checker must ignore unknown tags for forward compatibility. Rspamd will now behave properly and ignore unknown tags as specified in RFC.

### Upstreams support in `lua_http` and `lua_tcp` modules

It is possible now to use the functionality of the upstreams directly in Lua modules that use `lua_http` and `lua_tcp` libraries. It allows better support of the names resolution, IPv6 support for resolving the hostnames and internal handling of the upstreams logic by C code automatically.

### CNAME records support in the DNS resolver

Rspamd DNS resolver now supports querying and parsing of the CNAME records. This technique might be useful for fighting some specific spam patterns.

### Various memory leaks detected and plugged

In this release, we have found and fixed a good bunch of memory leaks and memory corruptions in the code.

## All significant changes

Here is the list of the important changes:

* [Feature] Allow lua_http module to accept upstreams
* [Feature] Allow to limit write access to fuzzy storage by key
* [Feature] Allow to sort symbols output
* [Feature] Check content for binary stuff before dumping it to Lua
* [Feature] Implement symbols augmentations
* [Fix] Add missing flags
* [Fix] Add more sanity checks for rua in dmarc_report
* [Fix] Adjust length of the fuzzy checks for short text parts
