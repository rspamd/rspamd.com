## Introduction

This guide describes the main steps to get and start working with Rspamd. In particular, we describe the following setup:

- Debian Jessie (or another OS with systemd)
- Postfix MTA
- Redis cache
- Dovecot with Sieve plugin to sort mail and learn by moving messages to `Junk` folder

For those who are planning migration from SpamAssassin, it might be useful to check the [SA migration guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/tutorials/migrate_sa.html)

## Alternative guides (3rd party)

* [Own mail server based on Dovecot, Postfix, MySQL, Rspamd and Debian 9 Stretch](https://thomas-leister.de/en/mailserver-debian-stretch/) - a good example of all-in-one tutorial about how to setup your own mail server
* [A guide to self-hosting your email on FreeBSD using Postfix, Dovecot, Rspamd, and LDAP.](https://www.c0ffee.net/blog/mail-server-guide) - similar to the previous guide but uses a different technologies stack
* [An alternative introduction to rspamd configuration](http://www.0xf8.org/2018/05/an-alternative-introduction-to-rspamd-configuration-introduction/)

## Preparation steps

First of all, you need a working <abbr title="Mail Transfer Agent">MTA</abbr> that can send and receive email for your domain using <abbr title="Simple Mail Transfer Protocol">SMTP</abbr> protocol. In this guide, we describe the setup of the [Postfix MTA](http://www.postfix.org/). However, Rspamd can work with other MTA software - you can find details in the [integration document]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/integration.html).

You should also consider to setup your own [local  DNS resolver]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/faq.html#resolver-setup).

### TLS Setup

It is strongly recommended to setup TLS for your mail system. We suggest to use certificates issued by [Let’s&nbsp; Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) as they are free to use and are convenient to manage. To get such a certificate for your domain you need to allow Let’s&nbsp;Encrypt to check your domain. There are many tools available for these purposes, including the official client and couple of alternative clients, for example [acmetool](https://github.com/hlandau/acme). The setup is fairly simple: just type (for Debian, Ubuntu and other Linux distributions)

    add-apt-repository ppa:hlandau/rhea
    apt-get update
    apt-get install acmetool
    acmetool quickstart
    acmetool want mail.example.com

In this guide, we assume that all services have the same certificate which might not be desired if you want greater levels of security.

### Postfix setup

We assume that you are installing Postfix with your OS's package manager (e.g. `apt-get install postfix`). Here is the desired configuration for Postfix:

You also need to create maps for access control and virtual aliases:

    touch /etc/postfix/virtual
    touch /etc/postfix/access
    postmap hash:/etc/postfix/virtual
    postmap hash:/etc/postfix/access

### Dovecot setup

For <abbr title="Internet Mail Access Protocol">IMAP</abbr> we recommend to install Dovecot. For Debian based systems you can use the following packages:

	apt-get install dovecot-imapd dovecot-sieve

Configuration of Dovecot (especially its authentication mechanisms) is a bit out of the scope for this guide but you can find many good guides at the [Dovecot main site](http://dovecot.org). By default, Dovecot uses Unix users in system and place mail into the standard mailbox `/var/mail/username`.

However, you should setup Postfix authentication. This lives in `/etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-master.conf`: make sure that you have uncommented the following lines in this file:

~~~
  # Postfix smtp-auth
  unix_listener /var/spool/postfix/private/auth {
    mode = 0666
  }
~~~

Furthermore, it might be useful to setup TLS to avoid passwords and other sensible information to be passed throughout insecure connections.

~~~
# /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-ssl.conf

ssl = required
ssl_cert = </var/lib/acme/live/mail.example.com/fullchain
ssl_key = </var/lib/acme/live/mail.example.com/privkey
~~~

## Caching setup

Rspamd uses  [Redis](https://redis.io) as a storage and caching system. In particular, Redis is used for the following purposes:

- a backend for tokens storage and cache of learned messages by [statistical module](configuration/statistic.html) (BAYES classifier)
- a fuzzy storage backend (optional)
- a key-value cache storage by [many Rspamd modules](configuration/redis.html#introduction)
- greylisting (delaying of suspicious emails)
- rate limiting
- whitelisting of reply messages (storing reply message IDs to avoid certain checks for replies to our own sent messages)

Installation of Redis is quite straightforward: install it using the preferred way for your OS (e.g. from packages), start redis-server with the default settings (it should listen on local interface using port 6379) and you are done. You might also want to limit memory used by Redis at some sane value:

    maxmemory 500mb
    maxmemory-policy volatile-lru

Please bear in mind that Redis could listen for connections from all network interfaces. This is potentially dangerous and in most cases should be limited to the loopback interfaces, with the following configuration directive:

    bind 127.0.0.1 ::1

For saving data to disk, it is also useful to setup overcommit memory behavior which might be useful for loaded systems. It could be done in Linux by using the following command:

    echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory

## Rspamd installation

The download process is described in the [downloads page]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads.html) where you can find how to get Rspamd, how to install it in your system, and, alternatively, how to build Rspamd from the sources.

## Running Rspamd

### Platforms with systemd (Arch, CentOS 7, Debian Jessie, Fedora, Ubuntu Xenial)

Packaging should start rspamd and configure it to run on startup on installation.

You can verify it's running as follows:

```
systemctl status rspamd
```

### Ubuntu, Debian Wheezy

To enable run on startup:

	update-rc.d rspamd defaults

To start once:

	/etc/init.d/rspamd start

### CentOS 6

To enable run on startup:

	chkconfig rspamd on

To start once:

	/etc/init.d/rspamd start

## Configuring Rspamd

Though Rspamd's default config aims to be useful for most purposes you may wish to make some adjustments to suit your environment/tastes.

### Using of configwizard

From version 1.7, there is a configuration wizard available as `rspamadm` subcommand. This wizard can help you to configure the most commonly used features in Rspamd, for instance:

* Redis server
* Controller password
* DKIM signing for outbound

To run wizard, use the following command:

```
rspamadm configwizard
```

This tool will guide you interactively throughout the configuration process using CLI interface.

### Manual configuration

First of all, please read the basic configuration principles [here](configuration/index.html).

There are some different approaches you can take to this:

1. **Not recommended: This will complicate upgrades:** Modifying the stock config files in `/etc/rspamd` directly. Your package manager will not replace the modified config files on upgrade - and may prompt you to merge changes or install these files with an added extension depending on your platform.

2. You could create an `rspamd.conf.local` and/or `rspamd.conf.override` file in the `/etc/rspamd` directory. What distinguishes these is the way in which they alter the configuration - `rspamd.conf.local` adds or _merges_ config elements while `rspamd.conf.override` adds or _replaces_ config elements. Both affect the top-level of configuration. Objects on this level are conventionally collections (`{}`) - which can be merged - as can lists `[]`, other types of settings are effectively overridden by merge operations according to their priority (site-local configuration files being higher priority than stock).

3. **Recommended where-ever possible** is use of special include files that are referenced in the stock configuration. Conventionally every configuration file in `/etc/rspamd/` will include two such includes:

~~~ucl
# /etc/rspamd/modules.d/imaginary_module.conf
imaginary_module {
  # there would probably be some settings in this area
  .include(try=true,priority=1,duplicate=merge) "$CONFDIR/local.d/imaginary_module.conf"
  .include(try=true,priority=10) "$CONFDIR/override.d/imaginary_module.conf"
}
~~~

Settings in `local.d` will be merged with stock configuration (where possible: ie. the setting is a list `[]` or collection `{}`) where-as settings in `override.d` will always replace the stock configuration. Unlike `rspamd.conf.local` and `rspamd.conf.override`, these includes are effective *inside* a given block of configuration (`{}`). Similarly to `rspamd.conf.override` settings in `override.d` have higher priority than settings generated by the web interface, unlike `local.d` and `rspamd.conf.local`.

### Overriding symbols scores and actions thresholds

You can read more about actions, scores and these configuration parameters in this [explanation]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/doc/faq.html#what-are-rspamd-actions).

Since Rspamd 1.7, you can edit `local.d/actions.conf` for thresholds setup:

~~~ucl
# local.d/actions.conf

 reject = 150; # Reject when reaching this score
 add_header = 6; # Add header when reaching this score
 greylist = 4; # Apply greylisting when reaching this score (will emit `soft reject action`)
~~~

For symbols scores, you should redefine scores defined in `scores.d/` directory where they are placed by a symbol's group. A simplier way to cange scores is using of the WebUI or `configwizard` routine (TBD).


**Pre 1.7 configuration**

For all Rspamd versions before 1.7, there was so called `metric` concept. Initially it was designed to split scoring of messages to multiple logical compositions. However, it has never been used and it was constantly a source of confusion.

For legacy setup, you can modify the following files.

 `/etc/rspamd/local.d/metrics.conf`:

~~~ucl
# /etc/rspamd/local.d/metrics.conf
symbol "BLAH" {
    score = 20.0;
}

group "Some group" {
    symbol "FOO" {
        score = 20.0;
    }
}
~~~

We can also use an override file. For example, let's redefine actions thresholds and set a more restrictive `reject` score. To do this, we create `etc/rspamd/local.d/metrics.conf` with the following content:

~~~ucl
# /etc/rspamd/local.d/metrics.conf
actions {
    reject = 150;
    add_header = 6;
    greylist = 4;
}
~~~

You need to define complete objects to override existing ones. For example, you **cannot** write something like

~~~ucl
# /etc/rspamd/local.d/metrics.conf
actions {
    reject = 150;
}
~~~

as this will set the other actions to be undefined.

Rspamd 1.7+ can still use legacy configuration converting them to the actual ones transparently on startup.

### One more note about scores

There are two components of the final score in Rspamd:

```
score = runtime_score * static_score
```

Runtime score is a concept used to express confidence. For example, you
have IP reputation and it changes in range `[-1;1]` smoothly. Then you
tell that static score for IP reputation is `3.0`. Hence,

```
score = runtime_score * static_score = 0.5 * 3.0 = 1.5
```

And you don't need to define something like

- IP_SCORE_TOO_BAD
- IP_SCORE_BAD
- IP_SCORE_SOMEHOW_BAD

... and so on to achieve this distinction.

### Other configuration advices

You should notice that individual files are included **within** sections:

    module { .include "..."; }

Hence, you don't need to repeat `module { ... }` inside the included file.

In addition to equivalents to files in `/etc/rspamd/modules.d` the following includes are referenced in the stock configuration (both of `local.d`/`override.d`):

 - `classifier-bayes.conf`: included inside `classifier "bayes" {}` block
 - `logging.inc`: included inside `logging { }`
 - `options.inc`: included inside `options { }`
 - `worker-normal.inc`: included inside normal `worker {}` block
 - `worker-controller.inc`: included inside controller `worker {}` block
 - `worker-proxy.inc`: included inside rspamd_proxy `worker {}` block


### Setting listening interface

Rspamd's normal worker will, by default, listen on all interfaces on port 11333. **From Rspamd `1.7.4`, it has changed to `localhost` by default**. 

If you're running Rspamd on the same machine as your mailer (or whatever will be querying it) you might want to set this to 'localhost' instead. This option should be defined in `/etc/rspamd/local.d/worker-normal.inc`:

~~~ucl
# /etc/rspamd/local.d/worker-normal.inc
bind_socket = "localhost:11333";
~~~

If you plan to leave this as is you may wish to use a firewall to restrict access to your machine. Please review the [worker documentation]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/doc/workers/) for more information about `bind_socket` and related settings.

Rspamd controller worker listens on the port `11334` by default, and the proxy worker uses port `11332` accordingly.

Because Rspamd skip some checks for local networks, you may want to tune global `local_addrs` map.

~~~ucl
# /etc/rspamd/local.d/options.inc

# Local networks (default)
local_addrs = "192.168.0.0/16, 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, fd00::/8, 169.254.0.0/16, fe80::/10";
~~~

Please review the [global options documentation]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/doc/configuration/options.html) for other global settings you may want to use.

## Using of Milter protocol (for Rspamd >= 1.6)

From Rspamd 1.6, rspamd proxy worker supports `milter` protocol which is supported by some of the popular MTA, such as Postfix or Sendmail. The introducing of this feature also finally obsoletes the [Rmilter](https://rspamd.com/rmilter/) project in honor of the new integration method. Milter support is presented in `rspamd_proxy` **only**, however, there are two possibilities to use milter protocol:

* Proxy mode (for large instances) with a dedicated scan layer
* Self-scan mode (for small instances)

Here, we describe the simplest `self-scan` option:

<img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/rspamd_milter_direct.png">

In this mode, `rspamd_proxy` scans messages itself and talk to MTA directly using Milter protocol. The advantage of this mode is its simplicity. Here is a samle configuration for this mode:

~~~ucl
# local.d/worker-proxy.inc
milter = yes; # Enable milter mode
timeout = 120s; # Needed for Milter usually
upstream "local" {
  default = yes; # Self-scan upstreams are always default
  self_scan = yes; # Enable self-scan
}
count = 4; # Spawn more processes in self-scan mode
max_retries = 5; # How many times master is queried in case of failure
discard_on_reject = false; # Discard message instead of rejection
quarantine_on_reject = false; # Tell MTA to quarantine rejected messages
spam_header = "X-Spam"; # Use the specific spam header
reject_message = "Spam message rejected"; # Use custom rejection message
~~~

For more advanced proxy usage, please see the corresponding [documentation]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/doc/workers/rspamd_proxy.html).

### Setting the controller password

Rspamd requires a password when queried from non-trusted IPs, except for scanning messages which is unrestricted (the default config trusts the loopback interface). This is configured in the file `/etc/rspamd/local.d/worker-controller.inc`.

You should store an encrypted password for better security. To generate such a password just type

	$ rspamadm pw
	Enter passphrase:
    $2$g95ywihfinjqx4r69u6mgfs9cqbfq1ay$1h4bm5uod9njfu3hdbwd3w5xf5d9u8gb7i9xnimm5u8ddq3c5byy 

The config to be modified is shown below (replace 'q1' with your chosen password):

~~~ucl
# /etc/rspamd/local.d/worker-controller.inc
password = "$2$g95ywihfinjqx4r69u6mgfs9cqbfq1ay$1h4bm5uod9njfu3hdbwd3w5xf5d9u8gb7i9xnimm5u8ddq3c5byy";
~~~

Optionally you may set `enable_password` - if set, data-changing operations (such as Bayes training or fuzzy storage) will require this password. For example:

~~~ucl
# /etc/rspamd/local.d/worker-controller.inc
enable_password = "$2$qda98oexjhcf6na4mfujqjwf4qmbi545$ijkrmjx96iyj56an9jfzbba6mf1iezpog4axpeym9qhtf6nhjswy";
~~~

From version 1.7, setting of passwords is also suggested by `rspamadm configwizard`.

**Important information**: the default passwords (namely, `q1` and `q2`) are **BANNED**, so you cannot use them in your installation. Please set the appropriate passwords before using of the controller.

Then you can copy this string and store it in the configuration file. Rspamd used the [PBKDF2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2) algorithm that makes it very hard to brute-force this password even if it has been compromised. From the version 1.3, Rspamd also supports [Catena](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/525.pdf) password hashing scheme which makes brute-force attacks even more memory- and computationally expensive.

For the list of all available hashing schemes, use `--list` option:

    $ rspamadm pw --list
    pbkdf2: PBKDF2-blake2b - standard CPU intensive "slow" KDF using blake2b hash function
    catena: Catena-Butterfly - modern CPU and memory intensive KDF

### Setting up the WebUI

WebUI is managed by a controller worker but you might want to proxy its requests using nginx, for example, to add `TLS` support. Here is a minimal setup required for nginx to do that:

<div>
<a class="btn btn-info btn-block btn-code" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#nginx_cf"><i class="fa fa-caret-square-o-down fa-pull-right"></i>nginx.conf</a><div id="nginx_cf" class="collapse collapse-block"><pre><code>
{% highlight nginx %}

        use epoll;
}

        add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains";
        add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;

		ssl_ecdh_curve prime256v1;
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}
</code>
</pre>
</div>
</div>

You might also use subdirs, as suggested by [@julienmalik](https://github.com/julienmalik):

<div>
<a class="btn btn-info btn-block btn-code" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#nginx_cf1"><i class="fa fa-caret-square-o-down fa-pull-right"></i>nginx.conf</a><div id="nginx_cf1" class="collapse collapse-block"><pre><code>
{% highlight nginx %}
location /rspamd/ {
    proxy_pass       http://localhost:11334/;

    proxy_set_header Host      $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
}
{% endhighlight %}
</code>
</pre>
</div>
</div>

Alternatively, you could setup HTTP authentication in nginx itself.

## Setup Redis statistics

From version 1.1, it is also possible to specify Redis as a backend for statistics and caching of learned messages. Redis is recommended for clustered configurations as it allows simultaneous learning and checking and, besides, is very fast. To setup Redis, you could specify `redis` backend for a classifier (cache is set to the same servers accordingly).

{% highlight ucl %}
# /etc/rspamd/local.d/classifier-bayes.conf
servers = "127.0.0.1";
backend = "redis";
{% endhighlight %}

Please review the full [statistics documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/configuration/statistic.html) for further information as well as the [Redis configuration documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/configuration/redis.html) if you plan to use Redis.

## Adjusting scores and actions

Unlike SA where there are only `spam` and `ham` results, Rspamd supports different results called [`actions`]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/doc/faq.html#what-are-rspamd-actions).

Each action can have its own score limit which can be modified by user settings. Rspamd assumes the following order of action thresholds: `no action` < `greylist` < `add header` < `rewrite subject` < `reject`.

Actions are **NOT** performed by Rspamd itself - they are just recommendations for the MTA (via milter interface, for example) which performs the necessary actions, such as adding headers or rejecting mail.

SA `spam` is almost equal to Rspamd `add header` action in the default setup. With this action, users will be able to check for messages in their `Junk` or `Spam` folder which is usually a desired behaviour.

Scores and action settings are defined in the `metric` section. To override existing settings, or add scores for new symbols, you can use the `rspamd.conf.local` file. Here is an example of altering the `reject` action, changing the existing symbol and adding new symbol:

{% highlight ucl %}
metric "default" {
    actions {
        reject = 900; # Set higher reject score
    }

    symbol "MAILLIST" {
        score = -4.1; # Rewrite score
    }

    symbol "MY_SYMBOL" {
        score = 2.1;
        description = "My new symbol";
    }
}

From Rspamd 1.7, this has changed: now all symbols are groupped per logical group, and all scores are set in `conf/scores.d`. To override these scores, it is recommended to use `local.d/xxx.conf` where `xxx` is one of the following groups:

* `fuzzy_group.conf` - fuzzy hashes scores
* `headers_group.conf` - various headers checks
* `hfilter_group.conf` - host filter symbols
* `mime_types_group.conf` - mime types rules
* `mua_group.conf` - MUA related rules
* `neural_group.conf` - neural network produced scores
* `phishing_group.conf` - URL phishing symbols
* `policies_group.conf` - policies (DKIM, SPF, DMARC, ARC)
* `rbl_group.conf` - RBL produced rules
* `statistics_group.conf` - Bayes statistics
* `subject_group.conf` - subject checks
* `surbl_group.conf` - URL blackslists symbols

You can also change weight of rules using the WebUI. To get the current information about symbols and scores, you can use `rspamc counters` command.


## Configuring maps

Another feature of Rspamd is maps support. Maps are lists of values, for example, domain names or ip/networks listed in an external file or by HTTP that are periodically monitored by Rspamd and reloaded in case of updates. This technique is useful for writing your own rules, whitelisting or blacklisting some networks and so on. The important difference with maps is that rspamd restart is not required when those lists are changed. Maps are defined as `URI` strings:

* `http://example.com/file.map` - HTTP map (server should respect `If-Modified-Since` header to avoid unnecessary updates)
* `file:///path/to/map` - file map
* `/path/to/map` - alternative syntax for file map

Within maps you can use whitespace or comments. For example, here is an example of ip/network map:

    # Example map
    127.0.0.1 # localhost

    10.0.0.0/8
    fe80::/64

There is a special module called `multimap` that allows you to define your own maps without writing lua rules. You can check the module's [documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/modules/multimap.html) and create your configuration in `local.d/multimap.conf`.

## Configuring RBLs

Though Rspamd is free to use for any purpose many of the RBLs used in the default configuration aren't & care should be taken to see that your use cases are not infringing. Notes about specific RBLs follow below (please follow the links for details):

[Spamhaus](https://www.spamhaus.org/organization/dnsblusage/) - Commercial use forbidden (see link for definition); Limit of 300k queries or 100k SMTP connections per day

[URIBL](http://uribl.com/about.shtml) - Requires a commercial subscription if 'excessive queries' are sent (numbers unclear).

[SURBL](http://www.surbl.org/usage-policy) - Commercial use forbidden (see link for definition); Limit of 1k users or 250k queries per day

[DNSWL](https://www.dnswl.org/?page_id=9) - Commercial use forbidden (see link for definition); Limit of 100k queries per day

[SpamEatingMonkey](http://spameatingmonkey.com/faq.html#query-limits) - Limit of 100k queries per day or more than 5 queries per second for more than a few minutes

[SORBS](http://www.sorbs.net/general/using.shtml#largesites) - Limit of 100k users or more than 5 messages per second sustained

[Mailspike](http://mailspike.net/usage.html) - Limit of 100k messages or queries per day

[UCEProtect](http://www.uceprotect.net/en/index.php?m=6&s=11) - If you're sending 100k queries or more per day you should use the (free) Rsync service.

Refer to the [RBL]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/doc/modules/rbl.html) and [SURBL]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/doc/modules/surbl.html) module documentation for information about disabling RBLs/SURBLs.

## Using Rspamd

### Using rspamc console routine

`rspamc` implements a feature-complete client for Rspamd. For detailed documentation refer to `man rspamc`.

Common use-cases for `rspamc` include:

* Scanning messages stored on disk:

~~~
rspamc < file.eml
rspamc file.eml
rspamc directory1/ directory2/*.eml
~~~

* Training the Bayesian classifier

~~~
rspamc learn_spam < file.eml
rspamc learn_ham file.eml
# In case of multiple classifiers
rspamc -c "bayes2" learn_spam directory1/ directory2/*.eml
~~~

* Administering fuzzy storage

~~~
rspamc -f 1 -w 1 fuzzy_add file.eml
rspamc -f 2 fuzzy_del file2.eml
~~~

* Acting as a local delivery agent (read the [integration document]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/integration.html))

### The rspamadm command

Rspamadm is a new utility that is intended to manage rspamd directly. It comes with embedded help that can be displayed by typing:

~~~
% rspamadm help
Rspamadm 1.5.0
Usage: rspamadm [global_options] command [command_options]

Available commands:
pw                 Manage rspamd passwords
keypair            Create encryption key pairs
configtest         Perform configuration file test
fuzzy_merge        Merge fuzzy databases
configdump         Perform configuration file dump
control            Manage rspamd main control interface
confighelp         Shows help for configuration options
statconvert        Convert statistics from sqlite3 to redis
fuzzyconvert       Convert statistics from sqlite3 to redis
grep               Search for patterns in rspamd logs
signtool           Sign and verify files tool
lua                Run LUA interpreter
dkim_keygen        Create dkim key pairs
~~~

For example, it is possible to get help for a specific configuration option by typing something like

    rspamadm confighelp -k fuzzy

See [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/doc/rspamadm.html) for more information about rspamadm utilities.

### Using mail system utilities

It is also useful to have a simple `Sieve` script to place all messages marked as spam in the `Junk` folder. Here is an example of such a script (~/.dovecot.sieve):

{% highlight nginx %}
require ["fileinto"];

if header :is "X-Spam" "Yes" {
        fileinto "Junk";
}
{% endhighlight %}

You can also setup rspamc to learn via passing messages to a certain email address. I recommend using `/etc/aliases` for these purposes and `mail-redirect` command (e.g. provided by [Mail Redirect addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/thunderbird/addon/mailredirect/) for `Thunderbird` MUA). The desired aliases could be the following:

    learn-spam123: "| rspamc learn_spam"
    learn-ham123: "| rspamc learn_ham"

You'd need some less predictable aliases to avoid sending messages to such addresses by some adversary or just by a mistake to prevent statistics pollution.

There is also an add-on for Thunderbird MUA written by Alexander Moisseev to visualise Rspamd stats. You can download it from its [homepage](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/thunderbird/addon/rspamd-spamness/). You'd need to add extended spam headers (`X-Spamd-Result`) with Rmilter and/or (from add-on's version 0.8.0) `X-Spam-Score` and `X-Spam-Report` headers with Exim to make the whole setup work.

To enable extended spam headers in Rmilter add the following line to `rmilter.conf`:

{% highlight ucl %}
spamd {
...
        extended_spam_headers = yes;
}
{% endhighlight %}

To enable headers in Exim refer to the "Integration with Exim MTA" section of the [MTA integration]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/integration.html) document.

Here is a screenshot of this addon in use:

### Using the WebUI

Rspamd has a built-in WebUI which supports setting metric actions and scores; Bayes training and scanning messages - for more information see the [WebUI documentation]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/webui).

## Using Rspamd in large email systems

Rspamd has been designed to be used in large scale email systems. It supports various of features to simplify processing emails for thousands or millions of users. However, the default settings are quite conservative to provide suitable experience for small grade systems.

First of all, you are strongly adviced to get the official Rspamd packages from `rspamd.com` site if you use debian derived Linux. They are heavily optimized in terms of performance and features. For users of other platforms it is adviced to ask Rspamd support (mailto://support@rspamd.com) about your specific demands. Maybe there are optimized packages for your specific platform that is not automatically built yet.

Secondly, you need to setup Redis. Normally, you need two types of Redis instances:

* Master-slave replicated instances for `persistent` data: statistics, fuzzy hashes, neural networks. These instances are mostly read-only so you can split your load over read-only slaves.
* Non-replicated but (probably) sharded instances for `volatile` data: greylisting, replies, ip reputation and other  temporary stuff. These instances are not required to be persistent and they could be scaled by sharding that is automatically performed by Rspamd if you specify multiple servers. These instances have mixed read-write payload.

You might also want to enable the following modules:

* [IP score]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/modules/ip_score.html): IP reputation module, requires volatile Redis instance (or shared volatile Redis instance). In some cases it can provide your results common to the expensive IP DNS black lists. However, it also depends on the quality of your rules and your scale.
* [Neural networks]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/modules/neural.html): this module provides significant improvement for your filtering quality but it requires CPU resources (SandyBridge or newer Intel CPUs are strongly adviced) and somehow good rules set. It also requires some setup and a persistent Redis instance. From the version 1.7 Rspamd uses `torch` for neural networks which demonstrates better performance and preciseness than the pre 1.7 implementation based on `libfann`. Here is a minimal setup for neural networks module:

```ucl
# local.d/fann_redis.conf
 servers = "redis:6384";
timeout = 25s; # Sometimes ANNs are very large
train {
        max_train = 2000; # How many training samples to store before learn
        spam_score = 9; # When to learn spam
        ham_score = -1; # When to learn ham
        mse = 0.001; # Target error
}
```

* [Ratelimit]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/modules/ratelimit.html): this module is very useful to limit spam waves as it allows to temporary delay senders that have either bad reputation or send email too agressively without somehow a good reputation. Requires a volatile Redis instance.
* [Replies]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/modules/replies.html): whitelists replies to your user's mail. It is very useful to provide users instant communication with known recipients. Requires a volatile Redis instance.
* [URL redirector]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/modules/url_redirector.html): resolves URL redirects on some common redirectors and URLs shorteners, e.g. `t.co` or `goo.gl`. Requires a volatile Redis instance.
* [Clickhouse]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/modules/clickhouse.html): saves analytical data to the [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.yandex) server. Clickhouse server can be used thereafter to create new filtering rules or maintaining blacklists. You can treat it as an advanced syslog with indexes and complex analytics queries. There are also graphical interfaces available for Clickhouse, e.g. for Grafana.
