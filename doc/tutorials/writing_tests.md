# Writing tests for Rspamd

Testing is an important part of maintaining stable product. In case of Rspamd, there was a historical lack of proper testing, however, we are working on improvements here. Any help from the community with regard to tests is much appreciated.

## Introduction

Rspamd has two types of tests:

* Unit tests - those type of tests are intended to test some particular function in Rspamd and are written in Lua + FFI (if testing plain C function) using [Telescope framework](https://github.com/norman/telescope);
* Functional tests - are used to test the whole daemon behaviour with complex setup involving custom configuration, external services, such as Redis, and so on. Functional tests are written using [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/).

## Unit tests

Unit tests are placed in `test/lua/unit`. Each tests defines testing context, where there are main definitions used by all test cases, for example, [FFI](http://luajit.org/ext_ffi.html) definitions:

```lua
context("Inet addr check functions", function()
  local ffi = require("ffi")

  ffi.cdef[[
  typedef struct rspamd_inet_addr_s rspamd_inet_addr_t;
  bool rspamd_parse_inet_address (rspamd_inet_addr_t **target,
    const char *src);
  void rspamd_inet_address_free (rspamd_inet_addr_t *addr);
  ]]
  
  ...
end)
```

Then, there could be some test cases:

```lua
  local cases = {
    {'192.168.1.1', true},
    {'2a01:4f8:190:43b5::99', true},
    {'256.1.1.1', false},
    {'/tmp/socket', true},
    {'./socket', true},
    {'[fe80::f919:8b26:ff93:3092%5]', true},
    {'[fe80::f919:8b26:ff93:3092]', true},
  }

  for i,c in ipairs(cases) do
    test("Create inet addr from string " .. i, function()
      local ip = ffi.new("rspamd_inet_addr_t* [1]");
      local res = ffi.C.rspamd_parse_inet_address(ip, c[1])
      assert_equal(res, c[2], "Expect " .. tostring(c[2]) .. " while parsing " .. c[1])
      if res then
        ffi.C.rspamd_inet_address_free(ip[0])
      end
    end)
```

Bear in mind, that a single `test` invocation should define one specific case.

Running unit tests requires to build a special `rspamd-test` target. If you use `make` to build Rspamd from the sources, you should type `make rspamd-test` to do it. After that, you would have `test/rspamd-test` binary available in your build directory. 

To run unit tests, just type `test/rspamd-test -p /rspamd/lua`

Unfortunately, it is currently impossible to execute specific unit tests only.

## Functional tests

Functional tests are intended to test the whole setup of Rspamd and you should first learn some basics about the [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) that is used to write tests.

Functional tests live in `test/functional` directory. To run functional tests, you first need to **install** Rspamd in your system (or a container). Then you can run them manually using something like `RSPAMD_INSTALLROOT=/usr/local robot -s '280*' ~/rspamd/test/functional/cases`, where:

* `RSPAMD_INSTALLROOT` - a prefix where Rspamd is installed (e.g. `/usr` for the vast majority of Linux installations)
* `-s` - pattern to match tests (may be skipped if all tests are needed)
* `~/rspamd/test/functional/cases` - directory where test cases are placed

Functional tests are also executed by [Rspamd CI](https://ci.rspamd.com/rspamd/rspamd). It also covers pull requests you send on the GitHub site.

### Functional tests structure

Each test usually has 3 components:

* Test case (written in Robot) that lives in `test/functional/cases`
* Some configuration that lives in `test/functional/configs`
* Messages to scan in `test/functional/messages`

In many cases you'd also need to have some specific Lua code that should be placed in `test/functional/lua`. For complicated setups, e.g. if you need some fake or real external service, you could need to write some Python code that should be placed to `test/functional/lib` and, for fake services, in `test/functional/util`.

You could find plenty of examples about how to run those fake servers in the existing tests.

### Test case structure

Each test is enclosed within some specific test case. Test case consist of `setup`, `set of tests` and `teardown`.

General testing advice on the Robot Framework is listed [here](https://github.com/robotframework/HowToWriteGoodTestCases/blob/master/HowToWriteGoodTestCases.rst).

Test case has also a preamble that defines some common variables and setup + teardown procedures:

```
*** Settings ***
Suite Setup     Rbl Setup
Suite Teardown  Rbl Teardown
Library         ${TESTDIR}/lib/rspamd.py
Resource        ${TESTDIR}/lib/rspamd.robot
Variables       ${TESTDIR}/lib/vars.py

*** Variables ***
${CONFIG}       ${TESTDIR}/configs/plugins.conf
${MESSAGE}      ${TESTDIR}/messages/spam_message.eml
${RSPAMD_SCOPE}  Suite
${URL_TLD}      ${TESTDIR}/../lua/unit/test_tld.dat
```

Setup procedure starts Rspamd using specific config file, teardown procedure, in turn, switches everything off. Both are listed in the `Keywords` section:

```
*** Keywords ***
Rbl Setup
  ${PLUGIN_CONFIG} =  Get File  ${TESTDIR}/configs/rbl.conf
  Set Suite Variable  ${PLUGIN_CONFIG}
  Generic Setup  PLUGIN_CONFIG

Rbl Teardown
  Normal Teardown
  Terminate All Processes    kill=True
```

Test cases are listed within `*** Test Cases ***` section:

```
*** Test Cases ***
RBL FROM MISS
  ${result} =  Scan Message With Rspamc  ${MESSAGE}  -i  1.2.3.4
  Check Rspamc  ${result}  FAKE_RBL_CODE_2  inverse=True

RBL FROM HIT
  ${result} =  Scan Message With Rspamc  ${MESSAGE}  -i  4.3.2.1
  Check Rspamc  ${result}  FAKE_RBL_CODE_2
```

### General advice on making test cases for Rspamd

* Always use fake DNS records:

~~~ucl
dns {
 fake_records = [
 { # ed25519
   name = "test._domainkey.example.com";
   type = txt;
   replies = ["k=ed25519; p=yi50DjK5O9pqbFpNHklsv9lqaS0ArSYu02qp1S0DW1Y="];
 },
 ...
 ]
}
~~~

* Use fake servers to emulate large software (e.g. a virus scanner)
* Try to reduce external dependencies, DNS requests, TCP requests etc
* Push all tests that require some specific config within a single test suite to avoid setup/teardown cost on testing
* Logs for tests are saved in `$(CURDIR)/robot-save`: you can find the exact configuration and the full debug logs for all tests; test name is enclosed in queue id of the messages to simplify logs reading
