## Protocol basics

Rspamd uses the HTTP protocol, either version 1.0 or 1.1. Rspamd defines some headers which allow the passing of extra information about a scanned message, such as envelope data, IP address or SMTP SASL authentication data, etc. Rspamd supports normal and chunked encoded HTTP requests.

## Rspamd HTTP request

Rspamd encourages the use of the HTTP protocol since it is standard and can be used by every programming language without the use of exotic libraries. A typical HTTP request looks like the following:

	POST /checkv2 HTTP/1.0
	Content-Length: 26969
	From: smtp@example.com
	Pass: all
	Ip: 95.211.146.161
	Helo: localhost.localdomain
	Hostname: localhost

	<your message goes here>

You can also use chunked encoding that allows streamlined data transfer which is useful if you don't know the length of a message.

## Rspamd protocol encryption

Rspamd supports encryption by means of lightweight protocol called HTTPCrypt. You can read details about this protocol in the following [paper](https://highsecure.ru/httpcrypt.pdf){:target="&#95;blank"}. To enable encryption, you need to generate keypair and push it in the corresponding worker's section (e.g. `worker-controller.inc` or `worker-normal.inc` or, even, in `worker-proxy.inc`):

```
$ rspamadm keypair

keypair {
    privkey = "e4gr3yuw4xiy6dikdpqus8cmxj8c6pqstt448ycwhewhhrtxdahy";
    id = "gnyieumi6sp6d3ykkukep9yuaq13q4u6xycmiqaw7iahsrz97acpposod1x8zogynnishtgxr47o815dgsz9t69d66jcm1drjei4a5d";
    pubkey = "fg8uwtce9sta43sdwzddb11iez5thcskiufj4ug8esyfniqq5iiy";
    type = "kex";
    algorithm = "curve25519";
    encoding = "base32";
}
```

Unfortunately, this protocol is not widely adopted by popular libraries, however, you can use it with `rspamc` client and with any other internal clients, including Rspamd proxy which can be used as an encryption bridge to perform spam scanning using Rspamd. You can also use Nginx to perform SSL termination for Rspamd. Rspamd client side (e.g. proxy or `rspamc`) supports SSL encryption natively, however, there is no support of SSL on the server's side so far.

### HTTP request

Normally, you should just use `/checkv2` here. However, if you want to communicate with the controller then you might want to use [controller commands](#controller-http-endpoints).

### HTTP headers

To avoid unnecessary work, Rspamd allows an MTA to pass pre-processed data about the message by using either HTTP headers or a JSON control block (described further in this document). Rspamd supports the following non-standard HTTP headers:

| Header          | Description                       |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| `Deliver-To` | Defines actual delivery recipient of message. Can be used for personalized statistics and for user specific options. |
| `IP`         | Defines IP from which this message is received. |
| `Helo`       | Defines SMTP helo |
| `Hostname`   | Defines resolved hostname |
| `From`       | Defines SMTP mail from command data |
| `Queue-Id`   | Defines SMTP queue id for message (can be used instead of message id in logging). |
| `Raw`        | If set to `yes`, then Rspamd assumes that the content is not MIME and treat it as raw data. |
| `Rcpt`       | Defines SMTP recipient (there may be several `Rcpt` headers) |
| `Pass`       | If this header has `all` value, all filters would be checked for this message. |
| `Subject`    | Defines subject of message (is used for non-mime messages). |
| `User`       | Defines username for authenticated SMTP client. |
| `Message-Length` | Defines the length of message excluding the control block. |
| `Settings-ID` | Defines [settings id](../configuration/settings.html) to apply. |
| `Settings` | Defines list of rules ([settings](../configuration/settings.html) `apply` part) as raw json block to apply. |
| `User-Agent` | Defines user agent (special processing if it is `rspamc`). |
| `MTA-Tag` | MTA defined tag (can be used in settings). |
| `MTA-Name` | Defines MTA name, used in `Authentication-Results` routines. |
| `TLS-Cipher` | Defines TLS cipher name. |
| `TLS-Version` | Defines TLS version. |
| `TLS-Cert-Issuer` | Defines Cert issuer, can be used in conjunction with `client_ca_name` in [proxy worker](../workers/rspamd_proxy.html). |
| `URL-Format` | Supported from version 1.9: return all URLs and email if this header is `extended`. |
| `Filename` | Hint for filename if used with some file. |

Controller also defines certain headers, see [here](#controller-http-endpoints) for detail.

Standard HTTP headers, such as `Content-Length`, are also supported.

## Rspamd HTTP reply

Rspamd reply is encoded in `JSON`. Here is a typical HTTP reply:

	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	Connection: close
	Server: rspamd/0.9.0
	Date: Mon, 30 Mar 2015 16:19:35 GMT
	Content-Length: 825
	Content-Type: application/json

~~~json
{
    "is_skipped": false,
    "score": 5.2,
    "required_score": 7,
    "action": "add header",
    "symbols": {
        "DATE_IN_PAST": {
            "name": "DATE_IN_PAST",
            "score": 0.1
        },
        "FORGED_SENDER": {
            "name": "FORGED_SENDER",
            "score": 5
        },
        "TEST": {
            "name": "TEST",
            "score": 100500
        },
        "FUZZY_DENIED": {
            "name": "FUZZY_DENIED",
            "score": 0,
            "options": [
                "1: 1.00 / 1.00",
                "1: 1.00 / 1.00"
            ]
        },
        "HFILTER_HELO_5": {
            "name": "HFILTER_HELO_5",
            "score": 0.1
        }
    },
    "urls": [
        "www.example.com",
        "another.example.com"
    ],
    "emails": [
        "user@example.com"
    ],
    "message-id": "4E699308EFABE14EB3F18A1BB025456988527794@example"
}
~~~

For convenience, the reply is LINTed using [JSONLint](http://jsonlint.com){:target="&#95;blank"}. The actual reply is compressed for speed.

Each reply has the following fields:

* `is_skipped` - boolean flag that is `true` if a message has been skipped due to settings
* `score` - floating point value representing the effective score of message
* `required_score` - floating point value meaning the threshold value for the metric
* `action` - recommended action for a message:
	- `no action` - message is likely ham (please notice space, not an underscore)
	- `greylist` - message should be greylisted
	- `add header` - message is suspicious and should be marked as spam (please notice space, not an underscore)
	- `rewrite subject` - message is suspicious and should have subject rewritten
	- `soft reject` - message should be temporary rejected (for example, due to rate limit exhausting)
	- `reject` - message should be rejected as spam
* `symbols` - all symbols added during a message's processing, indexed by symbol names:
    - `name` - name of symbol
    - `score` - final score
    - `options` - array of symbol options as an array of strings

Additional keys that could be in the reply include:

* `subject` - if action is `rewrite subject` this value defines the desired subject for a message
* `urls` - a list of URLs found in a message (only hostnames)
* `emails` - a list of emails found in a message
* `message-id` - ID of message (useful for logging)
* `messages` - object containing optional messages added by Rspamd filters (such as `SPF`)
        - The value of the `smtp_message` key is intended to be returned as SMTP response text by the MTA

## Milter headers

This block of reply is used to manipulate headers and SMTP session. It is placed under `milter` key in the reply. Here are possible elements in this object:

* `add_headers`: headers to add (object, indexed by header name)
* `remove_headers`: headers to remove (object, indexed by header name)
* `change_from`: change SMTP from value (plain string)
* `reject`: custom rejection (plain string value), e.g. `reject="discard"` or `reject="quarantine"`
* `spam_header`: custom spam header (plain string - header name)
* `no_action`: instead of doing any action to a message, just add header `X-Rspamd-Action` equal to that action and accept message (boolean value)
* `add_rcpt`: (from 1.8.0) add new recipients (array of strings)
* `del_rcpt`: (from 1.8.0) delete recipients (array of strings)

### Adding headers

`add_headers` element has the following format:

```json
{
    "<header_name>": {
        "value": "<header_value>",
        "order": 0
    },
}
```

Where `<header_name>` represents header's name, `<header_value>` - value, and `order` the order of insertion (e.g. 0 will be the first header).

### Removing headers

`remove_headers` element has the following format:

```json
{
    "<header_name>": 1
}
```

Where `<header_name>` represents header's name, and the value is the order of the header to remove (starting from 1). There are special treatment for orders `0` and negative order:

* if order is equal to zero, then it means that **all* headers with this name should be removed
* if order is negative, it means that the `N`th header from the **end** should be removed (where `N` is `abs(order)`)

### Complete example

```json
{
    "milter":
    {
        "add_headers": {
            "ArcMessageSignature": {
                "value": "some_value with JSON\nencoded values",
                "order": 0
            },
        },
        "remove_headers": {
            "DKIM-Signature": -1
        }
    }
}
```

## Rspamd JSON control block

Since Rspamd version 0.9 it is also possible to pass additional data by prepending a JSON control block to a message. So you can use either headers or a JSON block to pass data from the MTA to Rspamd.

To use a JSON control block, you need to pass an extra header called `Message-Length` to Rspamd. This header should be equal to the size of the message **excluding** the JSON control block. Therefore, the size of the control block is equal to `Content-Length - Message-Length`. Rspamd assumes that a message starts immediately after the control block (with no extra CRLF). This method is equally compatible with streaming transfer, however even if you are not specifying `Content-Length` you are still required to specify `Message-Length`.

Here is an example of a JSON control block:

~~~json
{
	"from": "smtp@example.com",
	"pass_all": "true",
	"ip": "95.211.146.161",
	"helo": "localhost.localdomain",
	"hostname": "localhost"
}
~~~

Moreover, [UCL](https://github.com/vstakhov/libucl) JSON extensions and syntax conventions are also supported inside the control block.

## Curl example

To check a message without rspamc:
`curl --data-binary @- http://localhost:11333/symbols < file.eml`

## Normal worker HTTP endpoints

The following endpoints are valid on the normal worker and accept `POST`:

* `/checkv2` - Check message and return action

## Controller HTTP endpoints

The following endpoints are valid merely on the controller. All of these may require `Password` header to be sent depending on configuration (passing this as query string works too).

* `/fuzzyadd` - Add message to fuzzy storage
* `/fuzzydel` - Remove message from fuzzy storage

These accept `POST`. Headers which may be set are:

- `Flag`: flag identifying fuzzy storage
- `Weight`: weight to add to hashes

* `/learnspam` - Train bayes classifier on spam message
* `/learnham` - Train bayes classifier on ham message

These also accept `POST`. The below endpoints all use `GET`:

* `/errors` - Return error messages from ring buffer
* `/stat` - Return statistics
* `/graph?type=<hourly|daily|weekly|monthly>` - Plots throughput graph
* `/history` - Returns rolling history
* `/actions` - Return thresholds for actions
* `/symbols` - Returns symbols in metric & their scores
* `/maps` - Returns list of maps
* `/getmap` - Fetches contents of map according to ID passed in `Map:` header
* `/fuzzydelhash` - Delete entries from fuzzy according to content of `Hash:` header(s)
