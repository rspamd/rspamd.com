# Metric exporter

Metric exporter collects statistics from Rspamd and feeds them to external monitoring/graphing systems. 
[Graphite](https://graphiteapp.org/) is the only supported backend for now. 

Besides, if you want to use `pull` model to collect statistics from Rspamd, we provide support for [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) endpoint.
Please have a look at [Controller worker](/doc/workers/controller.md) and [Controller HTTP endpoints](/doc/architecture/protocol.md#controller-http-endpoints)
for further information.

### Configuration

Non-backend-specific settings are shown below. Configuration could be added to `/etc/rspamd/local.d/metric_exporter.conf`:

~~~ucl
# Backend: just "graphite" for now - MUST be set
backend = "graphite";
# List of metrics to export - MUST be set.
# See next section for list of metrics
metrics = [
  "ham_count",
  "spam_count",
];
# Below settings are optional and values shown will be used as defaults if these are unset:
# Statefile: Path to file at which to persist last run information
statefile = "$DBDIR/metric_exporter_last_push";
# Timeout in seconds for pushing stats to backend
timeout = 15;
# Interval in seconds at which stats should be pushed
interval = 120;
~~~

Metrics which may be exported are as follows:
~~~ 
metrics = [
  "actions.add header",
  "actions.greylist",
  "actions.no action",
  "actions.reject",
  "actions.rewrite subject",
  "actions.soft reject",
  "bytes_allocated",
  "chunks_allocated",
  "chunks_freed",
  "chunks_oversized",
  "connections",
  "control_connections",
  "ham_count",
  "learned",
  "pools_allocated",
  "pools_freed",
  "scanned",
  "shared_chunks_allocated",
  "spam_count"
];
~~~

Additionally, backend-specific settings may be set. Graphite-specific settings are shown below:

~~~ucl
# Hostname for Carbon: "localhost" if unset
host = "localhost";
# Port for Carbon: 2003 if unset
port = 2003;
# Prefix for metric names: "rspamd" if unset
metric_prefix = "rspamd";
~~~
