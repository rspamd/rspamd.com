title: Rspamd proxy worker

# Rspamd proxy worker

This worker provides different functionality to build multiple layers systems and to handle Milter protocol. Here is a short list of functions provided by proxy worker:

* Forwarding of messages to scanning layer
* Directly interacting with MTA using Milter protocol
* Perform load balancing, retransmitting and health checks for scanning layer
* Add encryption and/or compression to the scan requests
* Mirror some portion of traffic to some test server
* Compare results of mirrored request
* Perform messages scan by own (self-scan mode)

## Milter support

From Rspamd 1.6, rspamd proxy worker supports `milter` protocol which is supported by some of the popular MTA, such as Postfix or Sendmail. The introducing of this feature also finally obsoletes the [Rmilter](https://rspamd.com/rmilter/) project in honor of the new integration method. Milter support is presented in `rspamd_proxy` **only**, however, there are two possibilities to use milter protocol:

* Proxy mode (for large instances) with a dedicated scan layer
* Self-scan mode (for small instances)

If your setup does not allow your MTA to reject mails set `discard_on_reject` (>= 1.6.2) to true for discarding spam-mails.

### Self-scan mode

In this mode, `rspamd_proxy` scans messages itself and talk to MTA directly using Milter protocol. The advantage of this mode is its simplicity. Here is a sample configuration for this mode:

~~~ucl
# local.d/worker-proxy.inc
upstream "local" {
  self_scan = yes; # Enable self-scan
}

# Proxy worker is listening on *:11332 by default
#bind_socket = localhost:11332;
~~~

Also you can disable<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup> [normal](normal.html) worker to free up system resources as it is not necessary in `self-scan` mode:

~~~ucl
# local.d/worker-normal.inc
enabled = false;
~~~

But there is a drawback: since `rspamc` uses [normal](normal.html) worker by default you need to explicitly point it to [controller](controller.html) worker port (11334)<sup>[2](#fn1)</sup>:

~~~
rspamc -h rspamd.example.org:11334 input-file
~~~

<a name="fn1">1.</a> The `enabled` option is available for workers since Rspamd 1.6.2, in  previous versions you can use `count = 0;` instead.

<a name="fn1">2.</a> When connecting to local IP `rspamc` uses controller port by default (1.7+).

### Proxy mode

In this mode, there is a dedicated layer of Rspamd scanners with load-balancing and optional encryption and/or compression. For this setup, the configuration might be different. Here is a small sample of proxy mode with 4 scanners where 2 scanners are more powerful and receive more requests:

~~~ucl
# local.d/worker-proxy.inc
upstream "scan" {
  default = yes;
  hosts = "round-robin:host1:11333:10,host2:11333:10,host3:11333:5,host4:11333:5";
  key = "..."; # Public key for encryption, generated by rspamadm keypair (optional)
  compression = yes; # Use zstd compression (optional)
}
~~~

## Mirroring

Proxy can be used to test:

* new versions of Rspamd;
* new plugins;
* new rules;
* configuration changes;
* ML models.

In this mode, Rspamd mirrors some portion of traffic to a test cluster. Results of their scans are ignored when returning reply to a client, however, optional compare scripts could be started to evaluate mirror results. Here is a sample configuration of this setup (we are not using milter mode in this sample):

~~~ucl
# local.d/worker-proxy.inc
# Main scan layer
upstream "scan" {
  default = "yes";
  hosts = "round-robin:host1:11333:10,host2:11333:10,host3:11333:5,host4:11333:5";
  key = "..."; # Public key for encryption, generated by rspamadm keypair
  compression = yes; # Use zstd compression
}

mirror "test" {
  hosts = "test:11333";
  probability = 0.1; # Mirror 10% of traffic
  key = "..."; # Public key for encryption, generated by rspamadm keypair
  compression = yes; # Use zstd compression
}
~~~

### Compare scripts

Compare scripts are intended to perform some simple actions with the results returned by a mirror and main cluster machine. They cannot do async request, so all you can do is to write to logs or to files. Here is a simple example of such a script in the configuration:

~~~ucl
# local.d/worker-proxy.inc
  script =<<EOD
return function(results)
  local log = require "rspamd_logger"

  for k,v in pairs(results) do
    if type(v) == 'table' then
      log.infox("%s: %s", k, v['score'])
    else
      log.infox("err: %s: %s", k, v)
    end
  end
end
EOD;
~~~
