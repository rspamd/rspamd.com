## Introduction

Rspamd has a number of logging options. Firstly, there are three types of log output that are supported: **console** logging - just output log messages to console, **file** logging - output log messages to a file and logging via **syslog** daemon. It is also possible to restrict logging to a specific level:

| Level          | Description                       |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| `error` | log only critical errors
| `warning` | log errors and warnings
| `notice` | log only important notices + scan messages results
| `info` | log all non-debug messages
| `silent` | log at `info` level on start and then reduce to `notice` level when forking worker processes
| `debug` | log all including debug messages (huge amount of logging)

It is possible to turn on debug messages for specific IP addresses. This can be useful for testing. For each logging type there are special mandatory parameters: log facility for syslog (read `syslog(3)` man page for details about facilities), log file for file logging. Also, file logging may be buffered for performance. To reduce logging noise, Rspamd detects sequential matching log messages and replaces them with a total number of repeats:

	#81123(fuzzy): May 11 19:41:54 rspamd file_log_function: Last message repeated 155 times
	#81123(fuzzy): May 11 19:41:54 rspamd process_write_command: fuzzy hash was successfully added

## Unique ID

From version 1.0, Rspamd logs contain a unique ID for each logging message. This allows finding relevant messages quickly. Moreover, there is now a `module` definition: for example, `task` or `cfg` modules. Here is a quick example of how it works: imagine that we have an incoming task for some message. Then you'd see something like this in the logs:

    2015-09-02 16:41:59 #45015(normal) <ed2abb>; task; accept_socket: accepted connection from ::1 port 52895
    2015-09-02 16:41:59 #45015(normal) <ed2abb>; task; rspamd_message_parse: loaded message; id: <F66099EE-BCAB-4D4F-A4FC-7C15A6686397@FreeBSD.org>; queue-id: <undef>

So the tag is `ed2abb` in this case. All subsequent processing related to this task will have the same tag. It is enabled not only on the `task` module, but also others, such as the `spf` or `lua` modules. For other modules, such as `cfg`, the tag is generated statically using a specific characteristic, for example the configuration file checksum.

## Configuration parameters

Here is the summary of logging parameters, each of those can be redefined or defined in `local.d/logging.inc` file:

| Parameter          | Description                       |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| `type` | Defines logging type (file, console or syslog). For some types mandatory attributes may be required.
| `filename` | Path to log file for file logging (required for **file** type)
| `facility` | Logging facility for **syslog** type (required if this type is used)
| `level` | Defines logging level (error, warning, info or debug).
| `log_buffered` | Flag that controls whether logging is buffered.
| `log_buf_size` | For file and console logging defines buffer size that will be used for logging output.
| `log_urls` | Flag that defines whether all URLs in message should be logged. Useful for testing. Default: `false`.
| `log_re_cache` | Output regular expressions statistics after each message. Default: `true`.
| `debug_ip` | List that contains IP addresses for which debugging should be turned on.
| `color` | Turn on coloring for log messages. Default: `false`.
| `systemd` | If `true` timestamps aren't prepended to log messages. Default: `false`.
| `debug_modules` | A list of modules that are enabled for debugging.
| `log_usec` | Log microseconds (e.g. `11:43:16.68071`). Default: `false`.
| `log_severity` (2.8+) | Log severity explicitly (e.g. `[info]` or `[error]`). Default: `false`.


### Defined debug modules

Here is a list of C debug modules defined in Rspamd (this list is usually incomplete):

| Module          | Description                       |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| `bayes` | messages from Bayes classifier
| `cfg` | configuration messages
| `composites` | debug composite symbols
| `dkim` | messages from dkim module
| `dns` | messages from DNS resolver
| `fuzzy_backend` | messages from fuzzy backend
| `langdet` | messages from language detector
| `logger` | messages from the logger itself
| `main` | messages from the main process
| `map` | messages from maps in Rspamd
| `milter` | debug milter interface
| `protocol` | debug protocol details
| `proxy` | messages from proxy
| `spf` | messages from spf module
| `stat_redis` | messages from redis statistics
| `symcache` | messages from symbols cache
| `task` | task messages
 
 Any Lua module can also be added to `debug_modules` as they are using somehow a similar naming semantics. E.g. you can use `dkim_signing` or `multimap` or `lua_tcp` to debug the corresponding modules.

## Log format

Rspamd supports a custom log format when writing information about a message to the log. (This feature is supported since version 1.1.) The format string looks as follows:


	log_format =<<EOD
	id: <$mid>,$if_qid{ qid: <$>,}$if_ip{ ip: $,}$if_user{ user: $,}$if_smtp_from{ from: <$>,}
	(default: $is_spam ($action): [$scores] [$symbols]),
	len: $len, time: $time_real real,
	$time_virtual virtual, dns req: $dns_req
	EOD

Newlines are replaced with spaces. Both text and variables are supported in the log format line. Each variable can have an optional `if_` prefix, which will log only if it is triggered. Moreover, each variable can have an optional body value, where `$` is replaced with the variable value (as many times as it is found in the body, e.g. `$if_var{$$$$}` will be replaced with the variable's name repeated 4 times).


### Log variables

Rspamd supports the following log variables:

| Variable          | Description                       |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| `action` | default metric action
| `digest` | cryptographic digest of a message's content (stripped to 16 bytes or 32 hex symbols)
| `dns_req` | number of DNS requests
| `filename` (from 1.8.0) | name of file if HTTP agent (e.g. rspamc) passes it
| `forced_action` (from 1.8.2) | forced action if form `<action> "<message>"; score=<score> (set by <module>)`
| `groups` (from 2.0) | symbols groups list for a task
| `ip` | from IP
| `is_spam` | a one-letter rating of spammyness: `T` for spam, `F` for ham and `S` for skipped messages
| `len` | length of message
| `lua` | custom Lua script (see below)
| `mid` | message ID
| `mime_from` | MIME from
| `mime_rcpt` | MIME rcpt - the first recipient
| `mime_rcpts` | MIME rcpts - all recipients
| `public_groups` (from 2.0) | public groups only (similar to groups but more restricted)
| `qid` | queue ID
| `scores` | summary of scores
| `settings_id` (from 2.0) | settings id for a message
| `smtp_from` | envelope from (or MIME from if SMTP from is absent)
| `smtp_rcpt` | envelope rcpt (or MIME from if SMTP from is absent) - the first recipient
| `smtp_rcpts` | envelope rcpts - all recipients
| `symbols_params` | list of all symbols and their options
| `symbols_scores_params` | list of all symbols, their scores and options
| `symbols_scores` | list of all symbols and their scores
| `symbols` | list of all symbols
| `time_real` | real time of task processing
| `time_virtual` (till 2.0) | CPU time of task processing
| `user` | authenticated user

Custom logging scripts could look like the following:

~~~lua
$lua{
  return function(task) 
    return 'text parts: ' .. tostring(#task:get_text_parts()) 
  end
}
~~~

this script will log number of text part in messages.
