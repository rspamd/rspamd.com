# Rspamd options settings

## Introduction

The options section defines basic Rspamd behaviour. Options are global for all types of workers. Some default options are shown in the following example snippet:

~~~hcl
filters = "chartable,dkim,regexp,fuzzy_check";
raw_mode = false;
one_shot = false;
cache_file = "$DBDIR/symbols.cache";
map_watch_interval = 5min;
map_file_watch_multiplier = 0.1;
dynamic_conf = "$DBDIR/rspamd_dynamic";
history_file = "$DBDIR/rspamd.history";
check_all_filters = false;
dns {
    timeout = 1s;
    sockets = 16;
    retransmits = 5;
}
upstream {
    resolve_min_interval = 60;
}
tempdir = "/tmp";
url_tld = "${PLUGINSDIR}/effective_tld_names.dat";
classify_headers = [
	"User-Agent",
	"X-Mailer",
	"Content-Type",
	"X-MimeOLE",
];

control_socket = "$DBDIR/rspamd.sock mode=0600";
~~~

## DNS options

These options fall under a dedicated subsection called `dns` and control the name resolution behavior of Rspamd. Here is a list of available tunables:

* `nameserver`: A list (or array) of DNS servers to be used. If this option is omitted, Rspamd will parse the `/etc/resolv.conf` file. Additionally, you can specify weights for DNS servers to balance the load. For example:

~~~hcl
options {
	dns {
		# 9/10 on 127.0.0.1 and 1/10 to 8.8.8.8
		nameserver = ["127.0.0.1:53:10", "10.0.1.1:53:1"];
	}
}
~~~

You can also specify another configuration of DNS servers selection strategy using [upstream](./upstream.html) syntax, e.g.:

~~~hcl
options {
	dns {
		nameserver = "master-slave:127.0.0.1:53:10,8.8.8.8:53:1";
	}
}
~~~

In this case, `8.8.8.8` public resolver will be used as a backup when local resolver is down. It's important to note that by default, Rspamd uses `round-robin` strategy which is also used when resolvers are read from `/etc/resolv.conf`.

* `timeout`: timeout for each DNS request
* `retransmits`: how many times each request is retransmitted before it is treated as failed (the overall timeout for each request is thus `timeout * retransmits`)
* `sockets`: how many sockets are opened to a remote DNS resolver; can be tuned if you have tens of thousands of requests per second).

## Neighbours list

The WebUI supports displaying and aggregating statistics from a cluster of Rspamd servers, as well as changing the configuration of all cluster members simultaneously.

On the Rspamd server where you want to point your web browser, add a `neighbours` list to the `local.d/options.inc`:

~~~hcl
neighbours {
    server1 { host = "host1.example.com"; }
    server2 { host = "host2.example.com"; }
    server3 { host = "10.10.10.10:11334"; }
}
~~~

There is no direct communication between cluster members. Rspamd sends the neighbours list to the web browser, and all subsequent communication occurs directly between the browser and the listed neighbours via HTTP requests.

Rspamd adds the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header if at least one server is configured in the `neighbours` section. Therefore, including at least one valid entry is necessary. The specifics of the `neighbours` configuration on other servers are not important, as long as there is at least one valid entry.

A minimal configuration with a dummy entry can look like this:

~~~hcl
neighbours {
    server1 { host = ""; }
}
~~~

However, if you plan to access the WebUI on this host, it is advisable to configure a more appropriate and relevant entry.

If you have [a reverse proxy with TLS]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/tutorials/quickstart.html#setting-up-the-webui) in front of Rspamd, explicitly specify the protocol and port in the `host` directive:

~~~hcl
neighbours {
    server1 { host = "https://host1.example.com:443"; }
    server2 { host = "https://host2.example.com:443"; }
}
~~~

By default, the protocol is `http` and the port is `11334`.

Additionally, you can use the same hostname but specify different paths for different servers:

~~~hcl
neighbours {
    server1 {
        host = "https://host.example.com:443";
        path = "/rspamd1";
    }
    server2 {
        host = "https://host.example.com:443";
        path = "/rspamd2";
    }
}
~~~

## Upstreams options

Upstreams logic and settings are described in the dedicated [document]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/configuration/upstream.html).
Options for upstreams fall under a dedicated subsection called `upstream` and control their behaviors in Rspamd. Here is a list of available tunables:

* `error_time` (defaults to `10`): timeframe to check errors in seconds
* `max_errors` (defaults to `4`): maximum count of errors during `error_time` to consider the upstream as down
* `revive_time` (defaults to `60`): time in seconds before attempting to recover an upstream after it has faced `max_errors` and has been marked as unhealthy
* `lazy_resolve_time` (defaults to `3600`, which is 1 hour): time in seconds to resolve upstream addresses in lazy mode
* `resolve_min_interval` (defaults to `60`): minimum interval in seconds to perform resolving upstream DNS resolution
